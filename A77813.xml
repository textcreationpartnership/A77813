            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>IT is ſad to ſee how the moſt of men neglect their precious ſouls, turning their backs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the glorious Goſpel, and little minding a crucified Jeſus, when in the mean while their bodies are well provided for, their eſtates much regarded, and the things of this preſent life are highly prized; as if the darling was of leſs value then a clod of earth, an immortal ſoul then a periſhing body, a precious Savior then unſatisfying creatures: Yea, though they have been often wooed with gracious intreaties, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious promiſes, and freſh bleeding wounds to make choice of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part, that ſhall never be taken from them, yet alas ſuch influence hath this world and the pleaſures
<pb facs="tcp:170678:3"/> of it, and ſuch is the blindneſs of their underſtandings, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill to hunt after thoſe things which cannot profit, nor be a help to them in the worſt hour; yea, that will prove no better then poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to their ſouls, and refuſe that would be (if embraced) their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs here, and their glory hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſuch a ſtrange ſtupidity hath ſeized upon the hearts of men, that they will venture the loſs of their immortall ſouls for a few dying comforts; and will expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to endleſs miſery, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments mirth, and ſhort-liv'd plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. But certainly a barn well fraught, a bag well fill'd, a back well cloathed, and a body well fed, will prove but poor comforts when men come to dye, when death ſhall not onely ſeparate their ſouls from their bodies, but both from their comforts. What will it then avail them that they have gained much? Or what will they give in exchange
<pb facs="tcp:170678:3"/> for their ſouls? Be wiſe then (O Reader, to whoſe ſight this may come) before it be too late, and thou repent, when repentance ſhall be hid from thine eyes; elſe it will be as a dagger to thine heart one day, to remember what a Chriſt, what a ſoul, what a heaven thou haſt loſt, for a few pleaſures, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mirth, a ſhort enjoyment of this preſent world; yea, and that after many warnings, againſt many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, and notwithſtanding the many tenders of a full Chriſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of thoſe empty vanities, which thy ſoul cloſed with, hunted after, and would by no means be perſwaded to part withall. No, but thou wouldeſt take thy time, and ſwim in this worlds delights, though thy ſoul thereby was drowned in perdition and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. True, few there are that will be perſwaded, that this courſe they take, though their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſations do bear witneſs
<pb facs="tcp:170678:4"/> to it: for how much time is ſpent, and how much care is the hearts of men fill'd withall, after attaining, keeping, and increaſing theſe things? And how ſeldom do they trouble their heads, to have their mindes taken up with thoughts of the better? Cumbring themſelves with many things, but wholly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the one thing neceſſary; yea, whereby do they meaſure their own or other mens happineſs, but by the large incomes of this worlds good, accounting this the greateſt, if not the onely bleſſedneſs, to have their corn, wine and oyl increaſe in abundance, and reckoning thoſe that are moſt ſerious about, and earneſt after the world to come, men of fooliſh ſpirits, giddy brains, and worthy to be branded in the forehead for ſimple deluded ones. But ſurely he is the moſt fool that will be one at laſt, and he that God calls ſo (<hi>Luke</hi> 12.20.) will paſs for one in the end: yea, within a
<pb facs="tcp:170678:4"/> ſhort time they themſelves ſhall change their notes. Ask the rich man ſpoken of in the enſuing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, who was the fool? he, or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus?</hi> and he will ſoon reſolve the queſtion, that he now ſees, and by wofull experience finds, (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever his former thoughts were) that he, not <hi>Lazarus</hi> was the ſilly deluded one, for he, fool like, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the worſe things before the better, and refuſed that which once might have been had, but now he hath ſlipt the time, it cannot be gained; when this poor man (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the day of his viſitation) was making ſure of that glory which he now enjoyes, and ſhall enjoy for evermore. So that in this Parable (if I may ſo call it) thou ſhalt finde that Scripture confirmed, <hi>That the triumphing of the wicked is ſhort,</hi> Job 20.5. Together with that, <hi>That the temptations (or afflictions) of the righteous, which cauſe heavineſs, are but for a ſeaſon,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.6. And in
<pb facs="tcp:170678:5"/> this treatiſe both of thoſe are large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened and explained. Behold here a rich man cloathed in ſilks, fed with delicates, and faring deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly every day: but look a little further, and ſo, this man cloathed with vengeance, roaring under tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and earneſtly begging for a drop of water to cool his tongue, a ſad change. On the other hand here thou ſhalt ſee a poor, but a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious man, with a pinched belly, naked back, and running ſoars, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the rich mans gate for a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to feed his belly, a ſad ſtate, yet but ſhort: for look again, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this beggar gloriouſly carried (as in a Chariot of triumph by the Angels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, ſhining in glory, cloathed with beautiful garments, and his ſoul ſat down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in the kingdom of the Father; his rags are gone, his ſoars healed, and his ſoul filled with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, and full of glory; the
<pb facs="tcp:170678:5"/> one carried not his coſtly fare, and his gorgeous apparel with him into hell, nor the other his courſe diet, mouldy bread, filthy rags, and ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous body into heaven; but the happineſs of the one, and the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the other took their leaves at the grave; the worldly mans porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was but for his life, and the godly mans afflictions laſted no longer, <hi>For mark the perfect, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the upright, for the end of that man is peace, but the end of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall be cut off,</hi> Pſal. 37.37, 38. His preſent comforts, his future hopes, and his curſed ſoul together; yea, though he lives many dayes, and rejoyces in them all, yet the dayes of darkneſs will overtake him, and his eye ſhall ſee no more good; in his life time he enjoyed his good things, and at the hour of death legions of devils will beſet him, innumerable evils will befall him: and then ſhall he pay full dear for all the pleaſures of ſin, that
<pb facs="tcp:170678:6"/> have carried away his heart from cloſing with, and following the Lord in the day of his proſperity. Ungodly men, becauſe they feel no changes now, they fear none here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, but flatter themſelves with dying as the godly, though their life is conſumed in wickedneſs, and their ſtrength in providing for, and ſatisfying the luſts of the fleſh, but as it fared with wicked <hi>Balaam,</hi> ſo ſhall it fare with theſe, and their vain hopes will prove a feeding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aſhes through their deceived heart, that hath turned them aſide, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 44.20. <hi>For they that ſow to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Galat. 6.8. <hi>And they that plow iniquity, and ſow wickedneſs, ſhall reap the ſame,</hi> Job 4.8. Hoſea 8.7. <hi>But they that ſow to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap life everlaſting.</hi> Say ye then to the righteous, it ſhall go well with him, however it goes with him now, a few dayes will produce a happy change, <hi>It ſhall go
<pb facs="tcp:170678:6"/> well with him that feareth the Lord,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.12. Go on then (O ſoul) thou that haſt ſet thy face towards heaven though the eaſt-wind beats upon thee, and thou finde trouble and ſorrow; theſe ſhall endure but for a night, joy will undoubtedly come in the morning: beſides thoſe ſweet viſits thou ſhalt have from thy precious Saviour in this thy day of darkneſs, wait but a while, and thy darkneſs ſhall be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to light. <hi>When the light of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall be put out, and the ſpark of his fire</hi> (wherewith he warmed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) <hi>ſhall not ſhine,</hi> Job 18.5. Grudge not to ſee the wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, and their ſteps waſhed with butter, but rather put on bowels of mercy, and pitty, as the elect of God, knowing that they are ſet in ſlippery places, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.18. And their day is coming, when fearful horrour ſhall ſuprize them, and hell be opened to receive them: nor yet be diſquieted in thy minde, that
<pb facs="tcp:170678:7"/> troubles and afflictions do beſet thee round: for as a worſer thing is reſerved for them, ſo a better is prepared for thee. Do they drink wine in bowls? and doſt thou min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle thy tears with thy drink? Do they live in pleaſures, and ſpend their dayes in wealth? and doſt thou ſigh and mourn in ſecret? Well, there is a cup for them in the hand of the Lord, the wine where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is red, and full of mixture, which they muſt drink up the dregs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.8. And the Lord hath a bottle for thy tears; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.8. And a book fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now conſidering that theſe lines may be brought to the ſight, both
<pb facs="tcp:170678:7"/> of the one ſort and the other, I ſhall lay a few things before the thought of each, and firſt to the worſer ſort.</p>
            <p>Firſt, conſider what an ill bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain thou wilt make to ſell thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoul for a ſhort continuance in thy ſins and pleaſures; if that man drives but an ill trade, who to gain the world, ſhould loſe his ſoul, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.26. then certainly thou a far worſe, that ſells thy ſoul for a very trifle. Oh, 'tis pitty that ſo precious a thing ſhould be parted withall, to be made a prey for the devouring lion, for that which is worſe then nothing; if they were branded for deſperate wretches, that cauſed their children to paſs through the fire to <hi>Molech,</hi> ſurely thou much more that gives thy ſoul to devouring flames, to be fewel for the everlaſting fire, upon ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie tearms; what meaneſt thou, O man, to truck with the devils? Is there no better merchandize to
<pb facs="tcp:170678:8"/> trade in, then what comes from hell, or out of the bowels of the earth? and to be had upon no low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rates, then thy immortal ſoul? Yes, ſurely the merchandize of wiſdom, which is better then the <hi>merechandize of ſilver, and the gain thereof then fine gold,</hi> Prov. 3.14. Prov. 8.19. is expoſed to ſale. Rev. 3.18. And to be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money or price; and if thou ſhouldeſt part with any thing for it, it is ſuch, that it is better to part withal then to keep. The wiſe Merchant that ſought a goodly pearl, having found one, ſold all that he had, not himſelf, not his ſoul; and all that he ſold was in it ſelf not worth a farthing, and yet obtained the Pearl, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.45, 46. <hi>Paul</hi> made the like exchange when he threw away his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which was but rags, yea, filthy rags, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 64.6. And put on the garment of ſalvation, and caſt away to the dunghil that which
<pb facs="tcp:170678:8"/> was once his gain, and won Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. Thou needeſt not caſt away thy ſoul for puddle pleaſures, behold the fountain of living water is ſet open, and thou invited to it, to take and drink thy belly, thy ſoul full without price or money, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.1.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> Take a ſhort (yet let it not be a ſlight) view of the beſt of the things men prize ſo high, that for the love of, they loſe their ſouls: what are they? Even painted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, promiſing vanities, (like the apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> fair to the eye, but being touched, turn to duſt: or like our Mother <hi>Eve's,</hi> that had a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful look, but being taſted, brings forth death) which for the moſt part have proved ſnares to the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and alwayes miſerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters at the parting, they cannot ſatisfie in life; for the more of theſe things are had, the more (with a diſquieted ſpirit) are they reached after, and what comes in, ſerves
<pb facs="tcp:170678:9"/> but to whet up the greedy unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied appetite after more. <hi>The world paſſeth away, and the lust thereof,</hi> 1 John 2.17. Though moſt men content themſelves with theſe, yet it is not in theſe to ſatisfie them, and had they but one glimpſe of the world to come, one cranny of light to diſcern the riches of Chriſt, and the leaſt taſte of the pleaſures that are at the right hand of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. They would be as little ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied without a ſhare in them, as they are now with what of worldly things they enjoy: much leſs can they eaſe from pain at death, clap a bag of gold (as one once did) to thy ſinking ſpirit, pained body, and tormented conſcience, and it can neither chear up the one, nor appeaſe the other, leaſt of all can they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from, or yield comfort after death; thoſe cannot ſerve as a bribe to death, to paſs thee by, nor yet bring comfort to thy ſoul, when thou art gone: the rich fools large
<pb facs="tcp:170678:9"/> crop and great increaſe, could not procure one nights reſpite, nor one moments comfort. Beſides, God regards them ſo little, that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he gives the largeſt ſhare of them, to whom he hateth moſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14. And the leaſt to them who are the excellent in the earth, in whom his ſoul delights, although he hath made them heirs of the Kingdom, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.5. Yet doth he beſtow but a ſmall portion of theſe worldly things upon them, hereby declaring to all, how little he ſets by thoſe things which moſt ſet ſo much by, and to draw up our hearts, mindes and affections to the things above: yea, <hi>His own Son that he appointed heir of all things,</hi> Heb. 1.2. ſhall come forth neither of rich kindred, nor attended with gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, nor yet accoutred with the worlds glory, but in a low, mean, and abject condition, at whoſe birth a manger received him, and through his life, ſorrows, wants,
<pb facs="tcp:170678:10"/> and ſufferings did attend, and at the end a ſhameful death (in the worlds eſteem) befals him, and by all this he ſhews his contempt of the worldly mans darling. Caſt not away thy ſoul then, O man, in ſeeking after, ſolacing thy ſelf in, and contenting thy ſelf with this preſent world; for though thou mayeſt make gold thy hope, and put thy confidence in thy wealth, yet when this thy hope ſhall fail, and thy confidence ſlip from thee, (as ſure it will ere long) glad would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou be of the leaſt drop of the water of life, and the leaſt filing of that precious gold, (that thou art now called upon to drink of, and to buy for thy ſelf) but alas they ſhall not be had, then: O then what profit will thy treaſures of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs yield thee! and whereto will thy thick clay that thou haſt hoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up, and thy carnal pleaſures which thou haſt drunk down, as the fiſh drinks down water: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:170678:10"/> I ſay will they ſerve, unleſs to weigh thee the deeper into hell, and increaſe the fire, when it ſhall be kindled upon thee.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, look upon thy loſs too, which is ſuch, that ten thouſand worlds cannot repair thy ſoul, thy body, thy comforts, thy hopes, thy ſhare in a crucified Jeſus, the crown of life, and everlaſting Communion with the Father, Son, and Spirit, bleſſed Angels, and glorified Saints, and a ſoul-ſatisfying, ſoul-ſaving Chriſt, who came from the boſome of love, and gave himſelf to open a way to everlaſting glory, by the ſacrifice of himſelf, to whom thou art called, invited, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to come; whoſe heart is open, arms ſpread, and who hath room enough in his boſome to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee, grace enough to pardon thee, blood enough to juſtifie thee, treaſures enough to enrich thee, pleaſures enough to delight thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.8. And glory enough to
<pb facs="tcp:170678:11"/> crown thee, <hi>In whom it hath pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwell,</hi> Coloſ. 1.19. to make them perfectly bleſſed that come to him; ſo that there is no need to ſeek happineſs among the creatures, which moſt do, and thereby loſe true happineſs, and their ſouls too; turn in hither, and thou ſhalt eat of his bread, and drink of the wine which he hath mingled, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.4, 5. Wouldeſt thou fare deliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every day, <hi>and have thy ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light it ſelf in fatneſs,</hi> Iſa. 55.2. Hearken diligently, and come to the wedding, the oxen and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.5. I tell thee, whatſoever food thou feedeſt upon elſe, will prove no better to thee, then the Prodigals husks, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.16. That will ſtarve thee whileſt thou feedeſt on them; &amp; if thou drinkeſt of other wine, it will prove as a cup of wine mixed with poiſon, which though it be pleaſant to the taſte, it will be
<pb facs="tcp:170678:11"/> the death of thy ſoul. Wilt thou then loſe this Chriſt, this food, this pleaſure, this heaven, this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for a thing of nought? Wilt thou drink out of a puddle, a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Ciſtern, which leaks out the water, and holds nothing but mud? and refuſe the fountain of living water, which whoſoever taſtes of, ſhall live for ever.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, beware of perſwading thy ſelf into a conceit of the poor mans end, if thou liveſt the rich mans life, and dyeſt his death. It is ſtrange to ſee how many run ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the very way to hell, yet are full of confidence of going to heaven, though Scripture every where ſhuts them out, and Chriſt at laſt will certainly ſhut them out for ever hereafter, living and dying in their preſent ſtate; let none therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, neither deceive your ſelves, for none ſuch can enter into the kingdom of heaven. <hi>But for theſe things ſake cometh the wrath of God on
<pb facs="tcp:170678:12"/> the children of diſobedience,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9. Epheſ. 5.5, 6. And how ſad will thy diſappointment be, that goeſt on ſecurely, fearing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, being fully (yet falſely) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of eternal life at laſt, and then drop down into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs pit? Like wicked <hi>Haman,</hi> that dreamed of greater honour, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a gallows: or our mother <hi>Eve,</hi> who conceited to be as God, but became a curſed creature. Though the devil may perſwade thee thou mayeſt live as in hell here, yet in heaven hereafter; believe him not, for he endeavours to keep thee in his ſnares, that he may drag thee to hell with him; and the better to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his deviliſh deſign upon thee, he will preſent (and through his curſed ſubtlety knows how to do it) thy ſins and this world, in as lovely and taking a guiſe as may be, but will hide the evil conſequences from thine eyes, that thou mighteſt be inveigled by gazing on the one,
<pb facs="tcp:170678:12"/> and not be afrighted by beholding the other; his bait ſhall be pleaſant, but his hook hid, like the ſtrumpet in <hi>Proverbs</hi> 7. That intices the ſimple with fair words, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals, that the way to her houſe leads to the chambers of death; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appears but a bed richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and a promiſe of ſolacing him with loves, but he that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after her, goeth as an ox to the ſlaughter, and as a fool to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ſtocks.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, this is thy day to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the loſs of the one, and to get an intereſt in the other, this is the day of ſalvation, the accepted day of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. Let the ſun of this day be ſet before this work be done, and an everlaſting night of darkneſs will cloſe thee in, wherein thou thou ſhalt have time enough indeed to bemoan thy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but none to learn to grow wiſer. It is a ſad thing (eſpecially in ſoul concernments) to be wiſe too late,
<pb facs="tcp:170678:13"/> and to cry out when time is paſt, Oh that I had improved it when it was preſent, then will the Remembrance of thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer miſpent time, and thy deſpair of ever gaining more, be like poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned arrows drinking up thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Amongſt all the talents God hath entruſted man withal, this is not the leaſt, becauſe on it depends eternity; and according to the uſe we make of this, will our eternal condition be, though the moſt of men live at ſuch a rate, as if it was given them to no other end, then to waſte in wickedneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume in pleaſures, what means elſe their ſpending dayes, weeks, moneths, years; yea, their whole life in whoring, ſwearing, playing, coveting and fulfilling the luſts of the fleſh, ſo that when they come to die, the great work that they were ſent to do, is then to be done; their ſouls, Chriſt, eternity was ſcarce thought on before; but now
<pb facs="tcp:170678:13"/> when mercileſſe death begins to gripe them, then do they begin to bethink themſelves of thoſe things which they ſhould have got in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs before, and that is the reaſon why we ſo often hear many that lie upon their death beds to cry out for a little longer time; and no wonder, for they have the ſalvation of their ſouls to ſeek. Oh ſad caſe! to have their work to do when the night is come, and a Chriſt to ſeek when death hath found them; take therefore the counſel of the holy Ghoſt, Heb. 3.7. <hi>To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</hi> Mark, it is the Spirits counſel; true, the devil and thine own heart will tell thee another tale, and be ready to whiſper in thine ears, thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have time enough hereafter, what need of ſo much haſte, another day may ſerve as well; let thy ſoul be filled with pleaſure a little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and thy bags filled a little more; thou mayeſt have time for
<pb facs="tcp:170678:14"/> this and that too. Oh but this is the ſuggeſtion of an enemy, that would cauſe thee to deferre ſo long, that thy heart may grow too hard, and thine ear too heavy to hear at all, but certainly this being thy greateſt buſineſs, challengeth the firſt and greateſt care, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. And let this be done, then if thou ſhalt either have ſo much time to ſpare, or a heart to do it, take thy time for the other.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, this day of thy mercy, and Chriſts importunity will not laſt long, it is but a day, and that a day of viſitation: indeed it is rich grace that there ſhould be a day, but dally not, becauſe it is but a day. Jeruſalem had her day, but becauſe therein ſhe did not know the things of her peace, a pitch night did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.42.43. It is a day of patience, and if thou deſpiſeſt the riches of Gods goodneſs, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and long-ſuffering towards thee, and art not thereby lead to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb facs="tcp:170678:14"/> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. A ſhort time will make it a day of vengeance, though now Chriſt calls, becauſe he is willing to ſave ſinners, yet he will not alwayes call; ſee then that thou refuſe not him that ſpeaks from heaven in this Goſpel-day, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25. <hi>But ſeek him while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near,</hi> Iſa. 55.6. leſt thou crieſt after him hereafter, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe thee. It is not crying Lord, Lord, when the day of grace is paſt, that will procure the leaſt crumb of mercy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21. No, if thou comeſt not when called, but ſtayeſt while ſupper is ended, thou ſhalt not taſte thereof, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.24. though a bit would ſave thy life, thy ſoul; if thou drinkeſt not of the fountain while it is opened, thou ſhalt not when it is ſhut, though thou beggeſt with tears of blood for one drop to cool thy ſcoarching flaming heart; thou that mighteſt have had thy veſſel full, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
<pb facs="tcp:170678:15"/> ſhalt not now have ſo much as will hang on the tip of a finger. Oh remember <hi>the axe is laid to the root of the tree,</hi> Matth. 3.10. And although three years time may be granted, through the Vine-dreſſers importunity, that will ſoon be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, and then the axe that is now laid, ſhall cut up the tree by its roots, if it bring not forth good fruit. Seeſt thou not? that many of late have been ſnatched away, on each ſide of thee (by that hand that hath been ſtretched out, and is ſo ſtill) and though thou mayſt eſcape a while, yet haſt thou no aſſurance that the deſtroying Angel will long paſs by thy door: Oh then, neglect thy ſoul no longer, but conſider time is ſhort, and uncertain, eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty long, thy work great, thy ſoul immortal, this world vaniſhing, Chriſt precious, hell hot, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven deſirable.</p>
            <p>And if thou beeſt a Chriſtian (to whom this may come) that haſt
<pb facs="tcp:170678:15"/> not onely had a price in thy hand, but wiſdom given thee from above to make uſe of it, and art one who (whilſt others are ſeeking to make this world and hell together ſure to themſelves) ſpendeſt thy time, and makeſt it thy onely buſineſs to make ſure of the one thing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and heaven to thy ſoul, I ſhall lay two or three things before thy thoughts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, walk with a fixed eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world to come, <hi>Look not at the things which are ſeen, that are temporal, but at the things which are not ſeen, that are eternal,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.18. A Chriſtians eye ſhould be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his journeys end, as our Lord Jeſus, who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. When the ſtones fled about <hi>Stephens</hi> ears, <hi>His eyes were lifted up to heaven, and ſaw the glory of God, and Jeſus standing on the right hand of God,</hi> Acts 7.55, 56. What though thou at preſent mayeſt lie
<pb facs="tcp:170678:16"/> at the rich mans gates, yet a few dayes will tranſlate thee into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> boſome. Though Iſrael had a ſharp voyage through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> men of excellent ſpirits, had their eye upon the good Land they were going to; though graceleſs ſouls are too dull fighted to ſee a far off, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. yet thou that haſt received the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from above, doſt in ſome meaſure know what is the hope of thy calling, and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints.</p>
            <p>Secondly, be ſatisfied with thy preſent condition, though it be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive, for it ſhall not laſt alwayes, thy ſorrows ſhall be ſhort, and thy joyes long; roul thy ſelf upon the Lord, for there is a heaven will pay for all; Chriſt firſt endured the croſs, before he wore the crown. <hi>David</hi> before he was a King, was a ſhepherd. The poor man ſpoken of in this enſuing Treatiſe, before
<pb facs="tcp:170678:16"/> he was carried into heaven, had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of ſorrow, and ſufferings on earth, Let the fleſh be ſilent in paſſing judgement on the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God towards thee, and the men of this world, in this preſent life. <hi>David</hi> by prying too far herein, with his own wiſdom, had almoſt caught a fall, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. Though Gods judgements may be too deep for our reaſon to dive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, yet are they alwayes righteous, <hi>and his paths mercy and truth to thoſe that keep his Covenants,</hi> Pſal. 25.10. When <hi>Jeremiah</hi> would debate with the Lord concerning his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the wickeds proſperity, he would lay this down as an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable truth, that his judgements were righteous, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1. And his end was not to charge God, but to learn underſtanding of him in the way of his judgements; and although the wayes of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may be dark to his people, that they cannot diſcern his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps,
<pb facs="tcp:170678:17"/> yet are they alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his everlaſting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the reſults of the favour he bears to them, <hi>If the wicked flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh like the graſs, it is that they ſhould be deſtroyed for ever,</hi> Pſal. 92.7. And if the godly have many a wave beating upon them, <hi>yet will the Lord command his loving kindneſs in the day time,</hi> Pſal. 42.7, 8. And after a little while being toſſed too and fro in theſe boiſterous waves, they ſhall arrive at the heavenly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, this world being not their reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, but there remains one for them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.9.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let the faith and hopes of a glorious deliverance, get thy heart up above thy preſent ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that thou mayeſt glory in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, who haſt ground of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in hope of the glory of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2, 3. For whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thy preſent grievances are, whether outward afflictions, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward temptations; this may be thy
<pb facs="tcp:170678:17"/> conſolation, that a few dayes will rid thee of them, when thou ſhalt ſigh no more, complain no more, but theſe ſhall be turned into prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: thou haſt (if I may ſo call it) all thy hell here, let thy life be expired, and thy miſery is ended; thy happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs begins, where wicked mens end; and when thine is once begun, it ſhall have no more end.</p>
            <p>Reader, I have an Advertiſement to thee concerning the following Diſcourſe, and the Authour of it. Thou haſt in the Diſcourſe many things of choice conſideration pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to thee in much plainneſs, evidence, and authority, the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are full, the applications are natural; be not offended at his plain and down-right language, it is for the diſcharge of the Authours conſcience, and thy profit, beſides the ſubject neceſſarily leads him to it. It is a mercy to be dealt tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly and plainly with, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb facs="tcp:170678:18"/> of thy ſoul; we have too many that ſowe pillows under mens el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bows; and too few, who dealing plainly, divide to every man his portion. Read it not to pick quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels with it, but to profit by it; and let not prejudice either againſt the Authour, or manner of delivery, cauſe thee to ſtumble and fall at the truth; prejudice will both blinde the eyes, that it ſhall not ſee the truth, and cloſe it in with it, and make them too quick ſighted, either to make faults where there is none, or to greaten them where they are; and ſo cauſe the Reader to turn the edge againſt the Authour, or his Work, that ſhould be turned upon his own heart. It is marvellous to ſee how the truth is quarrelled at, that comes from one, that would be eaſily received if it did drop from another: and I doubt not, if this Book had ſome other hand at it, there is ſcarce any expreſſion that may be now carpt at by ſome,
<pb facs="tcp:170678:18"/> but would have been ſwallowed without ſtraining. We are now fallen into ſuch an age, (the good Lord help us) that truth upon its own account, can challenge but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle acceptance, except the Authour be liked, or his lines painted with his own wit. But certainly truth is of ſo excellent a nature, of ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular advantage, and of ſo royal a deſcent, that it deſerves entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it ſelf, and that not in our houſes, or heads onely, but in our hearts too, whatſoever the hand is that brings it, or the form that it appears in; men account gold worth receiving, whatſoever the meſſenger is that brings it, or the veſſel that holds it.</p>
            <p>If thou meeteſt (Reader) with any paſſage that ſeems doubtful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, let love that thinks no evil put the beſt conſtruction upon it, and do not haſtily condemn, what thou canſt not preſently yield to; or if any expreſſion thou meeteſt
<pb facs="tcp:170678:19"/> with, may (haply) offend thee, do not throw aſide the whole, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to read of it no more; for though ſome one may offend thee, yet others (I hope) may affect thee; or if there be that which ſome may call Tautology, be not diſpleaſed at it; for that word that may not faſten upon thy heart in one page, may in another; and although it may be grievous to thy eye, (if thou beeſt nice and curious) yet bear with it, if it may be profitable to thy ſoul.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Authour (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the cenſures and reports of many are) I have this to ſay, That I verily believe God hath counted him faithful, and put him into the Miniſtery: and though his outward condition, and former employment was m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an, and his hamane learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſmall, yet is he one that hath acquaintance with God, and taught by his Spirit, and hath been uſed in his hand to do ſouls good: for
<pb facs="tcp:170678:19"/> to my knowledge there are divers, who have felt the power of the word delivered by him; and I doubt not, but that many more may, if the Lord continue him in his work; he is not like unto your drones, that will ſuck the ſweet, but do no work. For he hath laid forth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the utmoſt of his ſtrength, taking all advantages to make known to others, what he himſelf hath received of God: and I fear this is one reaſon why the Archers have ſhot ſo ſoarly at him; for by his, and others induſtry in their Maſters work, their ſlothfulneſs hath been reproved, and the eyes of many have been opened to ſee a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between thoſe that are ſent of God, and thoſe that run before they are ſent. And that he is none of thoſe light fanatick ſpirits, that our age abounds withal: this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe, together with his former, that have been brought to publique view will teſtifie; for
<pb facs="tcp:170678:20"/> among other things that may bear record to him herein, you ſhall find him magnifying and exalting the holy Scriptures, and largely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the worth, excelleny, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of them.</p>
            <p>And ſurely if thou ſhalt (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this) ſtumble at his meanneſs and want of humane learning, thou wilt declare thine unacquaintance with Gods decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red method, who to perfect his own praiſe, and to ſtill the enemy and avenger, <hi>Makes choice of Babes and Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Caſt thine eye back to the beginning of the Goſpel diſpenſation, (which ſurely if at any time ſhould have come forth in the wiſdom and glory of the world) and thou ſhalt ſee what method the Lord did take at the firſt to exalt his Son Jeſus: he goes not amongſt the Jewiſh Rabbi's, nor to the ſchools of learning, to fetch out his Goſpel Preachers, but to the trades, and thoſe moſt contemptible too; yet let not any from hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that I undervalue the gifts and graces of ſuch who have been, or now are endued with them, nor yet ſpeak againſt Learnnig, being kept in its place; but my meaning is, that thoſe that are learned ſhould not deſpiſe thoſe that are not; or thoſe that are not, ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe thoſe that are, who are faithful in the Lords work: and therefore being about to leave thee, I ſhall leave with thee two Scriptures to

            <p>O poor ſoul, if God and Chriſt did wiſh thee for thine harm, it would be another matter: then if thou didst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, thou mighteſt have ſome excuſe to make, ſome fault to finde, and ſome ground to make delayes. O but this is
<pb facs="tcp:170678:23"/> for thy profit, for thy advantage, for the pardoning of thy ſins, the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy ſoul, the delivering of thee from hell fire, from the wrath to come, from everlaſting burnings, into favor with God, Chriſt, and communion with all happineſs, (that is ſo indeed.)</p>
            <p>But it may be thou wilt ſay, all that hath been ſpoken to in this diſcourſe, is but a Parable, and Parables are no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities.</p>
            <p>I could put thee off with this anſwer, that though it be a Parable, yet it is a truth, and not a lie, and thou ſhalt finde it ſo too, to thy coſt, if thou ſhalt be found a ſlighter of God, Chriſt, and the ſalvation of thy own ſoul.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, know for certain, that the things ſignified by Parables, are wonderful realities. O what a glorious reality was there ſignified by that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable! <hi>The kingdom of heaven is like to a net that is caſt into the ſea, &amp;c.</hi> Signifying, that ſinners of all ſorts, of all Nations, ſhould be brought into Gods kingdom, by the net of the
<pb facs="tcp:170678:24"/> Goſpel. And O how real a thing ſhall the other part thereof be, when its ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, which ſaith, <hi>And when it was full, they drew it to ſhore, and put the good into veſſels, but threw the bad away;</hi> ſignifying the manſions of glory that the Saints ſhould have, and alſo the rejection that God will give to the ungodly, and to ſinners. And alſo that Parable, what a glorious reality is there in it, which ſaith, <hi>Except a corn of wheat fall to the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it doth bring forth much fruit.</hi> To ſignifie, that unleſs Jeſus Chriſt did indeed ſpill his blood, and die the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed death, he ſhould abide alone; that is, have never a ſoul into glory with him; but if he died, he ſhould bring forth much fruit, that is, ſave many ſinners. And alſo how real a truth there was in that Parable, concerning the Jews putting of Christ to death, which the poor diſperſed Jews can beſt experience to their coſt; for they have been almoſt ever ſince a baniſhed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb facs="tcp:170678:24"/> and ſuch as have had Gods ſore diſpleaſure wonderfully manifeſted againſt them, according to the truth of the Parable.<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 21. v. 33. to 41</note> O therefore for Jeſus Chriſts ſake, do not ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Why ſhould it be ſaid of thee, as it is ſaid of ſome, <hi>Theſe things are ſpoken to them that are without in parables, that ſeeing they might not ſee, and that hearing they might not underſtand</hi> Luke <hi>8.10.</hi> I ſay, take heed of being a quarreller a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Chriſt parables, leſt Chriſt alſo objecteth againſt the ſalvation of thy ſoul at the judgement day.</p>
            <p>Friend, I have no more to ſay to thee now, it may be ſhortly thou mayeſt hear from me again, in a diſcourſe touching the Covenant of Works, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace; it had been with thee now, had opportunity been afforded me;

Now if thou doſt love me, pray for me, that my God would not forſake me, nor take his holy Spirit from me; and that God would fit me to do and ſuffer, what ſhall be from the world or devil inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me. I muſt tell thee, the world ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they ſtamp and ſhake their heads, and fain they would be doing: the Lord help me to take all they ſhall do with patience, and when they ſmite the one cheek, to turn the other to them, that I may do as Chriſt hath bidden me; for then the Spirit of God, and of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall reſt upon me.

For he ſpake them to the end, that after gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſhould take notice thereof, and fear, leſt they alſo fell into the ſame condition.</p>
            <p>Now in my diſcourſe upon theſe words, I ſhall not be tedious, but as briefly as I may, I ſhall paſs through the ſeveral Verſes, and lay you down ſome of the ſeveral truths contained therein: and the Lord grant that they may be profitable, and of great advantage to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170678:28"/> thoſe that read them, or hear them read.</p>
            <p>The 19 and 20 verſes alſo, I ſhall not ſpend much time upon, onely give you three or four ſhort hints, and ſo paſs to the next verſes; for they are the words I do intend moſt eſpecially to inſiſt upon.</p>
            <p>The 19, 20, and 21, verſes run thus, <hi>There was a certain rich man, which was cloathed in purple and fine linnen, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red deliciouſly or ſumptuouſly every day. And there was a certain beggar named La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus, which was laid at his gate full of ſores, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. If theſe verſes had been ſpoken by Jeſus Chriſt, and no more, all the world would have gone near to have caſt a wrong interpretation on them. I ſay, if Jeſus had ſaid onely thus much, <hi>There was a certain rich man that fared ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly daily, and a certain beggar laid at his gate full of ſores.</hi> The world would have made this concluſion of them, the rich man was the happy man. For at the firſt view it doth repreſent ſuch a thing. But take all together, (that is) read the whole Parable, and you ſhall finde, that there is no man in a worſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170678:28"/> condition then he, as I ſhall clearly hold forth afterward.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, if a man would judge of men according to outward appearance, he ſhall oft-times take his mark amiſs. Here is a man to outward appearance, appears the onely bleſſed man; better by half then the beggar, in as much as he is rich, the beggar poor; he is well cloathed, but peradventure the beggar is naked; he hath good food, but the beggar would be glad of dogs meat; <hi>(And he deſired to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich mans table)</hi> the rich man fares well every day, but the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar muſt be glad of a bit when he can g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t it. Oh! who would not be in the rich mans ſtate? A wealthy man, ſorts of new ſuits, and dainty diſhes every day: enough to make one, who mindes nothing but his belly, and his back, &amp; his luſts, to ſay, Oh, that I were in that mans condition! Oh that I had about me as that man had! Then I ſhould live a life indeed; then ſhould I have hearts eaſe good ſtore; then I ſhould live pleaſantly, and might ſay to my ſoul, Soul, be of good chear, eat, drink and be merry, thou haſt every
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170678:29"/> thing plenty, and art in moſt bleſſed condition.</p>
            <p>I ſay this might be, I, and is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion with them that judg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arance. But if the whole Parable be well conſidered, you will ſee, that that which is had in high eſtimation with men, is an abomination in the ſight of God. And again, that condition that is the ſaddeſt condition, according to outward appearance, is oft times t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e moſt excellent; for the beggar had t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n thouſand degrees the beſt of it, though to outward appearance his ſtate was the ſaddeſt; from we ſhall obſerve thus much.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That thoſe who judge according to outward appearance, do for the moſt part judge amiſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they who look upon their outward enjoyments to be tokens of Gods ſpecial grace unto them, are alſo deceived; for as it is here in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, a man of wealth, and a childe of the devil may make but one perſon; or thus, a man may have abundance of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enjoyments, and yet be carried by the devils into eternal burnings. But this is the trap, in which the devil hath
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170678:29"/> caught many thouſands of poor ſouls, namely, by getting them to judge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to outward appearance.</p>
            <p>Do but ask a poor carnal covetous wretch, how we ſhould know a man to be in a happy eſtate, and he will anſwer, Thoſe that God bleſſeth, and giveth abundance of this world unto; when for the moſt part they are they that are the the curſed men. Alas poor men, they are ſo ignorant, as to think, that becauſe a man is increaſed in outward things, and that by a ſmall ſtock, therefore God doth love that man with a ſpecial love, or elſe he would never do ſo much for him, never bleſs him ſo, and proſper the work of his hands. Ah! poor ſoul, it is the rich man that goes to hell. <hi>And the rich man died, and in hell,</hi> mark, <hi>in hell he lift up his eyes, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Methinks to ſee how the great ones of the world will go ſtrutting up and down the ſtreets ſometimes, it makes me wonder. Surely, they look upon themſelves to be the onely happy men, but it is becauſe they judge according to outward appearance; they look upon themſelves to be the onely bleſſed men when the Lord knows, the generality

Wouldeſt thou be glad to be kept out of heaven with a back well cloathed, and a belly well filled with the dainties of this world?

               <p>BY theſe words our Lord Jeſus doth ſhew us the frame of a Chriſtians heart, and alſo the heart and carriage of worldly men toward the Saints of the Lord: the Chriſtians heart is held forth by this, that any thing will content him while he is on this ſide glory. <hi>And he deſired to be fed with the crumbs,</hi> the dogs meat, any thing. I ſay a Chriſtian will be content with any thing, if he have but

No, then the dogs will be beguild, that muſt be preſerved for the dogs. From whence obſerve, that the ungodly world do love their dogs better then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. You will ſay that's ſtrange. It is ſo indeed, yet it is true, as will be clearly manifeſted, as for inſtance. How many pounds do ſome men ſpend in a year on their dogs, when in the mean while the poor Saints of God may ſtarve for hunger. They will build houſes for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170678:34"/> their dogs, when the Saints muſt be glad to wander, and lodge in dens and caves of the earth: and if they be in any of their houſes for the hire there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>f, they will warn them out, or eject them, or pull down the houſe over their heads, rather then not rid themſelves of ſuch Tenants. Again, ſome men cannot go half a mile from home, but they muſt have their dogs at their heels; but they can very willingly go half a ſcore miles without the ſociety of a Chriſtian Nay, if when they are buſie with their dogs they ſhould chance to meet a Chriſtian, they would willingly ſhift him if they could. They will go on the other ſide of the hedge or the way, rather then they will have any ſociety with him; and if at any time a child of God ſhould come into an houſe where there are but two or three ungodly wretches, they do commonly wiſh either themſelves, or the Saint out of doors; and why ſo? Becauſe they cannot down with the ſociety of a Chriſtian: though if there come in at the ſame time a dog, or a drunken ſwearing wretch, which is worſe then a dog, they will make him welcome, he ſhall ſit down with them, and partake of their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170678:34"/> dainties. And now tell me, you that love your ſins and your pleaſures; had you not rather keep company with a drunkard, a ſwearer, a ſtrumpet, a thief; nay, a dog (as I ſaid before) then with an honeſt hearte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> your ſowre carriage to the people of God? Why do you look on them, as if you would eat them up? yet at the very ſame time if you can but meet your dog, or a drunken compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you can fawn upon them, take ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with them, to the Tavern or Ale-houſe with them, if it be two or three times in a week; but if the Saints of God meet together, pray together, and labour to edifie one another, you will ſtay till doomes-day (as they call it) before you will look into the houſe where they are. Ah friends, when all comes to all, you will be found to love drunkards, ſtrumpets, dogs, any thing; nay, to ſerve the devil, rather then to have loving and friendly ſociety with the Saints of God.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>The dogs came and licked his ſores]</hi> Here again you may ſee, not onely the afflicted ſtate of the Saints of God in this world, but alſo, that even
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170678:35"/> dogs themſelves, according to their kind, are more favourable to the Saints, then the ſinful world; though the ungodly will have no mercy on the Saints, yet it is ordered ſo, that theſe creatures, dogs, lions, &amp;c. will. Though the rich man would not entertain hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> into his houſe, yet his dogs will come, and do him the beſt good they can even to lick his run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſores. It was thus with <hi>Daniel,</hi> when the world was mad againſt him, and would have him thrown to the lions to be devoured, the lions ſhut their mouthes at him, (or rather the Lord did ſhut them up) ſo that there was not that hurt befell to him, as was deſired by the adverſaries. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. And this I am perſwaded of, that would the creatures do as ſome men would have them, the Saints of God ſhould not walk ſo qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly up and down the ſtreets, and other places, as they do. And as I ſaid before, ſo I ſay again, I am perſwaded, that at the day of judgement many mens condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and carriages will be ſo laid open, that it will evidently appear, they have been very mercileſs, and mad againſt the children of God; inſomuch, that when the providence of God did fall out ſo, as

                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 22.</note> they have been very much offended thereat, as is very evidently ſeen in them who ſet themſelves to ſtudy how to bring the Saints into bondage, and to thruſt them into corners, as in theſe late years.

Hence then let the Saints learn not to commit themſelves to their enemies, they are very mercileſs men, and will not ſo much favour you, (if they can help it) as you may ſuppoſe they may. Nay, unleſs the over-ruling hand of God in goodneſs do order things contrary to their naturall inclination, they will not favour you ſo much as a dog.</p>

But ſo ſoon as he did but perceive the finger of an hand, writing, then (ſaith the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) the Kings countenance was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and his thoughts troubled him, ſo <hi>that the joynts of his loins were looſed, and his knees ſmote one againſt another.</hi> And when <hi>Paul</hi> told <hi>Felix</hi> of Righteouſneſs,<note place="margin">Acts 24.25.</note> Temperance, and Judgement to come, it made him rremble. And let me tell thee (Soul) whoſoever thou art, that if thou didſt but verily believe that thou muſt die, and come into the judgement, it would make thee turn over a new leaf, as we ſay.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170678:38"/> keep out of the heart as much as in him lies, the thoughts of paſſing from this life into another world; for he knows, if he can but keep them from the ſerious thoughts of death, he ſhall the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily keep them in their ſins; and ſo from cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Their houſes are ſafe from fear,</hi>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170678:38"/> that is, the devil will fetch away thy ſoul from thee. And here it comes to paſs, mens not being exerciſed with the thoughts of departing this life, that they are ſo unexpected to themſelves and their neighbours, taken away from the pleaſures and profits; yea, all the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they buſie themſelves withall while they live in this world. And hence it is again, that you have ſome in your towns and cities that are ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly taken away, ſome from haunting the Ale-houſe, others from haunting the Whore-houſes, others from playing and gaming, others from the cares and covetous deſires after this world, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for as by themſelves, or their companions. Hence it is alſo, that men do ſo wonder at ſuch tidings as this, there is ſuch an one dead, ſuch an one is departed; it is becauſe they do ſo little conſider, both the tranſitorineſs of themſelves and their neighbours: for had they but their thoughts well exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed about the ſhortneſs of this life, and the danger that will befall ſuch as do miſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it would make them more wary and ſober, and ſpend more time in the ſervice of God,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170678:39"/> and be more delighted and diligent in enquiring after the Lord Jeſus, who is the deliverer from wrath to come. For as I ſaid before, it is evident, that they who live after the fleſh in the luſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, do not really and ſeriouſly think on death, and the judgement that doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after, neither do they indeed endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſo to do; for did they, it would make them ſay with holy <hi>Job.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 14.14.</note> 
                  <hi>All the dayes of my appointed time will I wait till my change come.</hi> And as I ſaid before, that not onely the wicked, but alſo the godly have their time to depart this life. <hi>And the beggar died.</hi> The Saints of the Lord, they muſt be deprived of this life alſo, they muſt yield up the Ghoſt into the hands of the Lord their God; they muſt alſo be ſeparated from their wives, children, husbands, friends, goods, and all that they have in the world.

               <p>But it may be objected, if the godly do die as well as the wicked, and if the ſaints muſt appear before the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170678:39"/> ſeat as well as the ſinners; then what advantage have the godly more then the ungodly, and how can the Saints be in a better condition then the wicked?</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Read the 22<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> verſe over again, and you ſhall finde a marvellous difference between them, as much as is between heaven and hell, everlaſting joy, and everlaſting torment; for you finde, that when the beggar died, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the godly. <hi>He was carried by the Angels into Abrahams boſome,</hi> or into everlaſting joy;<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 1.</note> but the ungodly are not ſo, but are hurried by the devils into the bottomleſs pit: for he ſaith, <hi>And in hell he lift up his eyes.</hi> When the ungodly do die, their miſery beginneth; for then appear the devils, like ſo many lions, waiting every moment till the ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the body. Sometimes they are very viſible to the dying party, but ſometimes more inviſible; but alwayes this is certain, they never miſs of the ſoul, if it do die out of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but do hale it away to the priſon, as I ſaid before, there to be tormented, and reſerved until that great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral day of judgement, at which day they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170678:40"/> muſt body and ſoul receive a final ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence from the righteous Judge, and from that time be ſhut out from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God into everlaſting woe and diſtreſs. But the godly, when the time of their departure is at hand, then alſo are the Angels of the Lord at hand; yea, they are ready waiting upon the ſoul to conduct it ſafely into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom. I do not ſay, but the devils are oft times very buſie doubtleſs, and attending the Saints in their ſickneſſe; I, and no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but they would willingly deprive the ſoul of glory. But here is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as the devils come from hell to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the ſoul, (if it be poſſible, at its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture) ſo the Angels of the Lord come from heaven to watch over and conduct the ſoul (in ſpite of the devil) ſafe into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> had the comfort of this, and ſpeaks it forth for the comfort of his Brethren. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 34.7. ſaying, <hi>The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</hi> Mark, the Angels of the Lord encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth round about his children, to deliver them. From what? From their enemies, of which the devil is not the leaſt. This
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170678:40"/> is an excellent comfort at any time to have the holy Angels of God to attend a poor man or woman; but eſpecially it is comfortable in the time of diſtreſs, at the time of death, when the devils beſet the ſoul with all the power that hell can afford them. But now it may be, that the glorious Angels of God do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the firſt, to the view of the ſoul; nay, rather it may be, hell ſtands before it, and the devils ready, as if they would carry it thither. But this is the comfort, the Angels do alwayes appear at the laſt, and will not fail the ſoul, but will carry it ſafe into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
               <p>Ah Friends! conſider, here is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man upon his death bed, and he hath none to ſpeak for him, none to ſpeak comfort unto him; but it is not ſo with the children of God, for they have the Spirit to comfort them. Here is the ungodly, and they have no Chriſt to pray for their ſafe conduct to glory, but the Saints have an Interceſſour.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 17.</note> Here is the world, when they die, they have none of the Angels of God to attend upon them; but the Saints have their company. In a word, the unconverted
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170678:41"/> perſon when he dieth, he ſinks into the bottomleſs pit. But the Saints when they die, do aſcend with, and by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom, or into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to unſpeakable glory.</p>
               <p>Again, it is ſaid that the rich man when he died was buried, or put into the earth, but when the beggar died, he was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Angels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom. The one is a very excellent ſtile, where he ſaith, he was carried by the Angels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome; it denotes the excellent condition of the Saints of God, as I ſaid before; and not onely ſo, but alſo the preciouſneſs of the death of the Saints in the eyes of the Lord, that after generations may ſee how precious in the ſight of the Lord the death of his Saints is, when he ſaith, they are carried by the Angels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome. Thus many times the Lord adorneth the death and departure of his Saints, to hold forth unto after generations, how excellent they are in his eyes. It is ſaid of <hi>Enoch,</hi> that God took him; of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he died in a good old age of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the Lord buried him; of <hi>Elijah,</hi> that he was taken up into heaven; that the Saints ſleep in Jeſus; that they die
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170678:41"/> in the Lord; that they reſt from their labour; that their works follow them; that they are under the Altar; that they are with Chriſt; that they are in light; that they are to come with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to judge the world. All which ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſignifie thus much, That to die <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Saint is very great honour and dignity. But the ungodly are not ſo. The rich or ungodly die, and are buried, he is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his dwelling to the grave, and there he is buried, hid in the duſt; and his body doth not ſo faſt molder and come to nought there, but his name doth ſtink as faſt in the world: as ſaith the holy Scripture, <hi>The name of the wicked ſhall rot.</hi> And indeed the names of the godly are not in ſo much honour after their departure, but the wicked and their names do as much rot. What a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to poſterity was the death of <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, Agag, Achitophel, Haman, Judas He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> with the reſt of their companions. So that though the wicked have their names written in the earth, and they do periſh and rot, yet the name of the Saints do caſt forth a dainty ſavour to following generations: and that the Lord Jeſus doth ſignifie where he ſaith,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170678:42"/> The godly are carried by the Angels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome. And that the wicked are nothing worth; where he ſaith, The ungodly die and are buried.</p>

               <p>THe former verſe ſpeaks onely of the departure of the ungodly out of this life, together with the glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct that the godly have into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their Father. Now our Lord doth ſhew in this verſe, partly, what doth, and ſhall befall to the reprobate after this life is ended, where he ſaith, <hi>And in hell he lift up his eyes.]</hi> That is, the ungodly after they depart this life, do lift up their eyes in hell. From theſe words may be obſerved theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is an hell for ſouls to be tormented in when this life is ended. Mark, after he was dead and buried. <hi>In hell he lift up his eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That all that are ungodly, and do live and die in their ſins, ſo ſoon as ever they die they go into hell: he died,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170678:42"/> and was buried. <hi>And in hell he lift up his eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That ſome are ſo faſt aſleep, and ſecure in their ſins, that they ſcarce know well where they are, till they come into hell, and that I gather from theſe words, <hi>In hell he lift up his eyes.</hi> He was aſleep before, but hell makes him lift up his eyes.</p>
               <p>As I ſaid before, it is evident that there is an hell for ſouls; yea, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies too, to be tormented in after they depart this life, as is clear. Firſt, becauſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that cannot lie, did ſay, that after the ſinner was dead and buried, <hi>In hell he lift up his eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if it be objected, that hell is here meant the grave, that I plainly deny. Firſt, becauſe there the body is not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of torment or eaſe; but in that hell, into which the ſpirits of the damned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, they are ſenſible of torment, and would be very willingly freed from it, to enjoy eaſe, which they are ſenſible of the want of; as is clearly diſcovered in this Parable. <hi>Send Lazarus that he may dip, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not meant the grave, but ſome
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170678:43"/> other place, becauſe the bodies ſo long as they lie there, are not capable of lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their eyes, to ſet the glorious condition of the children of God, as the ſouls of the damned do. <hi>In hell he lift up his eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It cannot be the grave, for then it muſt follow, that the ſoul was buried there with the body, which cannot ſtand with ſuch a dead ſtate as is here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; for he ſaith, <hi>The rich man died;</hi> that is, his ſoul was ſeparated from his body. <hi>And in Hell he lift up his eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be again objected, that there is no hell but in this life, that I do alſo deny, as I ſaid before; after he was dead and buried, <hi>In hell he lift up his eyes.</hi> And let me tell thee, O ſoul, whoever thou art, that if thou cloſe not in ſavingly with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and lay hold on what he hath done, and is doing in his own perſon for ſinners, thou wilt finde ſuch an hell after this life is ended, that thou wilt not get out of again for ever and ever. And thou that art wanton, and doeſt make but a mock at the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord, when they tell thee of the torments of hell, thou wilt finde,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170678:43"/> that when thou departeſt out of this life, that hell, even the hell which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life, will meet thee in thy jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney thither, and will with its helliſh crew give thee ſuch a ſad ſalutation, that thou wilt not forget it to all eternity, when that Scripture comes to be fulfilled on thy ſoul, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.9. where it is ſaid, <hi>Hell from beneath it moved for thee, to meet thee at thy comming: it ſtirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth: it hath raiſed from their thrones all the kings of the nations. All they,</hi> that is, that are in hell ſhall ſay, <hi>Art thou become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?</hi> O ſometimes when I have had but thoughts of going to hell, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the everlaſtingneſs of their ruine that fall in thither; it hath ſtirred me up rather to ſeek to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to deliver me from thence, then to ſlight it, and make a mock at it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in hell he lift up his eyes.]</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing I told you, was this, That all the ungodly that live and die in their ſins, ſo ſoon as ever they depart this life, do deſcend into hell. This is alſo verified by the words in this parable, where Chriſt ſaith, He died and was buried, <hi>and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170678:44"/> in hell he lift up his eyes.</hi> As the tree falls, ſo it ſhall lie, whether it be to heaven or hell. And as Chriſt ſaid to the thief on the Croſs, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> Even ſo the devil in the like manner may ſay unto thy ſoul, To morrow ſhalt thou be with me in hell. See then what a miſerable caſe he that dies in an unregenerate ſtate is in; he departs from a long ſickneſs to a longer hell; from the gripings of death to the everlaſting torments of hell. <hi>And in hell he lift up his eyes.</hi> Ah Friends! if you were but your ſelves, you would have a care of your ſouls; if you did but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard you would ſee how mad they are that ſlight the ſalvation of their ſouls. O what will it profit thy ſoul to have pleaſure in this life, and torments in hell; thou hadſt better part with all thy ſins and pleaſures, and companions, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou delighteſt in, then to have ſoul and body to be caſt into hell. O then, do not now neglect our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, leſt thou drop down to hell. Conſider, would it not wound thee to thine heart, to come upon thy death-bed, and inſtead of having the comfort of a well-ſpent life, and the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170678:44"/> merits of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, together with the comforts of his glorious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: to have, firſt, the ſight of an ill-ſpent life, thy ſins flying in thy face, thy conſcience uttering it ſelf with thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps againſt thee, the thoughts of God terrifying of thee, death with his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs paw ſeizing upon thee, the devils ſtanding ready to ſcramble for thy ſoul, and hell enlarging her ſelf, and ready to ſwallow thee up; and eternity of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and torment attending upon thee, from which there will be no releaſe. For mark, death doth not come alone to an unconverted ſoul, but with ſuch compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as wert thou but ſenſible of, it would make thee tremble. I pray conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Scripture. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.8. <hi>And I looked, and beheld a pale ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> on him was Death, and hell followed with him.</hi> Mark, death doth not come alone to the ungodly; no, but hell goeth with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im. O miſerable comforters! O miſerable ſociety! here comes death and hell unto thee. Death goeth into thy body, and ſeparates body and ſoul aſunder; hell ſtands without (as I may ſay) to embrace, or rather to cruſh thy ſoul between its everlaſting
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170678:45"/> grinders. Then thy mirth, thy joy, thy ſinful delights will be ceaſed when this comes to paſs; lo, it will come. Bleſſed are all thoſe, that through Chriſt Jeſus his merits, by faith, do eſcape theſe ſoul-murthering companions. <hi>And in hell he lift up his eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing you know that we did obſerve from theſe words, was this, That ſome are ſo faſt aſleep, and ſecure in their ſins, that they ſcarce know where they are, untill they come into hell. And that you know I told you I gather by theſe words. <hi>In hell he lift up his eyes.</hi> Mark, it was in hell that he lift up his eyes. Now ſome do underſtand by theſe words, that he came to himſelf, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conſider with himſelf, or to think with himſelf in what an eſtate he was, and what he was deprived of; which is ſtill a confirmation of the thing laid down by me. There it is that they come to themſelves, that is, there they are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible where they are indeed; thus it fares with ſome men, that they ſcarce know where they are, till they lift up their eyes in hell. It is with theſe people, as with thoſe that fall down in a ſwoun; you know if a man do fall down in a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170678:45"/> ſwoun in one room, though you take him up, and carry him into another, yet he is not ſenſible where he is, till he cometh unto himſelf, and lifteth up his eyes.</p>
               <p>Truly thus it is to be feared, it is with many poor ſouls, they are ſo ſenſeleſs, ſo hard, ſo ſeared in their conſcience, that they are very ignorant of their ſtate; and when death comes, it ſtrikes them, as it were, into a ſwoun, (eſpecially if they die ſuddenly) and ſo they are hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, and ſcarce know where they are, till in hell they lift up their eyes.</p>
               <p>Of this ſort are they ſpoken of in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 73. where he ſaith, <hi>There are no bonds in their death, but their ſtrength is firm. They are not troubled as other folk, neither are they plagued like other men.</hi> And again, they ſpend their dayes in wealth, and in a moment, mark, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before they are aware, they go down to the grave, <hi>Job</hi> 21.17.</p>
               <p>Indeed this is too much known by woful and daily experience, ſometimes when we go to viſit them that are ſick in the towns and places where we live, Oh how ſenceleſs, how ſeared in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are they? they are neither ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170678:46"/> of heaven, nor of hell; of ſin, nor a Saviour: ſpeak to them of their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the ſtate of their ſouls, and you ſhall finde them as ignorant, as if they had no ſouls to regard. Others, though they lie ready to die, yet they are buſying themſelves about their outward affairs, as though they ſhould certainly live here, even to live and enjoy the ſame for ever. Again, come to others, ſpeak to them about the ſtate of their ſouls, though they have no more experience of the new birth then a beaſt, yet will they ſpeak as confidently of their eternal ſtate, and the welfare of their ſouls, as if they had the moſt excellent experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any man or woman in the world, When as I ſaid even now, the Lord knows they are as ignorant of the new birth, of the nature and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith, of the witneſs of the Spirit: as if there were no new birth, no faith, no witneſs of the Spirit of Chriſt in any of the Saints in the world. Nay, thus many of them are, even an hour or leſs before their departure. Ah poor ſouls, though they may go away here like a lamb, as the world ſayes, yet if you could but follow them a little to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170678:46"/> ſtand and liſten ſoon after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; It is to be feared you ſhould hear them roar like a lion at their firſt entrance into hell.</p>
               <p>Now by this one thing doth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil take great advantage on the hearts of the ignorant, ſuggeſting unto them, that becauſe the party deceaſed, departed ſo quietly, without all doubt they are gone to reſt and joy: when alas, it is to be feared, the reaſon why they went away ſo quietly, was rather becauſe they were ſenſeleſs and hardened in their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; yea, dead before in ſins and treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. For had they had but ſome awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on their death beds, as ſome have had, they would have made all the town to ring of their doleful condition, But becauſe they are ſeared and ignorant, and ſo depart quietly: therefore the world takes heart at graſs, (as we uſe to ſay) and make no great matter of living and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they cannot well tell how. But let them look to themſelves; for if they have not an intereſt in the Lord Jeſus, now while they live in the world, they will, whether they die raging or ſtill, go unto the ſame place, and lift up their eyes in hell.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:170678:47"/>
               <p>O my friends, did you but know what a miſerable condition they are in, that go out of this world without an intereſt in the Son of God, it would make you ſmite upon your thigh, and in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your ſouls cry out, Men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved? And not onely ſo, but thou wouldeſt not be comforted, until thou didſt finde a reſt for thy ſoul in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>Something in brief I have obſerved from the firſt part of this verſe, namely from theſe words, <hi>And in hell he lift up his eyes.</hi> And indeed I have obſerved but ſomething, for they are very full of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and many things poſſibly might be taken notice of in them. There is one thing more that I might touch upon, as touched in this ſaying, and that is this, Methink the Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth hereby ſignifie, that men are naturally unwilling to ſee or take notice of their ſad ſtate, I ſay by nature; but though now they are willingly ignorant, yet in hell they ſhall lift up their eyes. That
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170678:47"/> is, in hell they ſhall ſee and underſtand their miſerable condition; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to theſe words, <hi>In hell he lift up his eyes,</hi> he added, <hi>being in torment.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Though once they ſhut their eyes, though once they were willingly ignorant, yet when they depart into hell, they ſhall be ſo miſerably handled and tormented, that they ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to lift up their eyes. For while men live in this world, and are in a naturall ſtate, they will have a good conceit of themſelves, and of their condition; they will conclude that they are Chriſtians, and their ſtate to be as good as the beſt; they will conclude they have faith, the Spirit, good hope, and an intereſt in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: but then, when they drop into hell, and lift up their eyes there, and behold, firſt their ſoul to be in extream torments; their dwelling to be the bottomleſs pit; their company thouſands of damned ſouls; alſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable company of devils; and the hot ſcalding vengeance of God, not onely to drop, but to fall very violently upon them; then they will begin to be awakened, who all their life time were in a dead ſleep. I ſay, when this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170678:48"/> comes to paſs, Lo it will, then in hell they ſhall lift up their eyes, in the midſt of torments they ſhall lift up their eyes.</p>
               <p>Again, you may obſerve from theſe words. <hi>And in hell he lift up his eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in torment.</hi> That the time of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly mens ſmarting for their ſins, will be in the torments of hell. Now here I am put to a ſtand, when I conſider the torments of hell, into which the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned do fall. O unſpeakable torments! O endleſs torments! Now that thy ſoul might be made to flee from theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable torments, into which the damned do go. I ſhall ſhew you darkly and briefly what are the torments of hell. Firſt, by the means of it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the ſad ſtate thou wilt be in, if thou comeſt there. Firſt the names. It is called <hi>a never dying worm.</hi> Mark 9. It is called <hi>an oven, fire hot,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi 4.1. It is called <hi>a furnace, a fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,</hi> Mat. 13. It is called <hi>the bottomleſs pit, the unquenchable fire, fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, hell fire, the lake of fire, devouring fire, everlaſting fire, eternal fire, a ſtream of fire.</hi> Rev. 21.</p>
               <p>Firſt, one part of thy torments will
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170678:48"/> be this, thou ſhalt have a full ſight of all thy ill-ſpent life from firſt to laſt, though here thou canſt ſin to day, and forget it by to morrow; yet there thou ſhalt be made to remember how thou didſt ſin againſt God at ſuch a time,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50.</note> and in ſuch a place, for ſuch a thing, and with ſuch an one, which will be an hell unto thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thou ſhalt have the guilt of them all lie heavy on thy ſoul, not onely the guilt of one or two, but the guilt of them all together, and there they ſhall lie in thy ſoul, as if thy belly were full of pitch, and ſet on a light fire. Now here men can ſometimes think on their ſins with delight, but there with unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able torment; for that I underſtand to be the fire that Chriſt ſpeaketh of, which ſhall never be quenched. Mark, while men live here, O how doth the guilt of one ſin ſometimes cruſh the ſoul, it makes a man in ſuch plight, that he is weary of his life, ſo that he can neither reſt at home nor abroad, neither up nor in bed. Nay, I do know, that they have been ſo tormented with the guilt of one ſinful thought, that they have been even at their wits end. But now when thou
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170678:49"/> comeſt into hell, and haſt not onely one or two, or an hundred ſins with the guilt of them all on thy ſoul and body; but all the ſins that ever thou didſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſince thou cameſt into the world, all together clapt on thy conſcience at one time, as one ſhould clap a red hot iron to thy breaſts, and there to continue to all eternity, this is miſerable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, then thou ſhalt have brought into thy remembrance the ſlighting of the Goſpel of Chriſt; here now thou ſhalt conſider how willing Chriſt was to come into the world to ſave ſinners, and for what a trifle thou didſt reject him. This is plainly held forth in <hi>Eſay</hi> 28. where ſpeaking of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the foundation of ſalvation, ver. 16. he ſaith of them that reject the Goſpel, that when the overflowing ſcourge doth paſs through the earth, (which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to be at the end of the world) then ſaith he, <hi>It ſhall take you morning by morning, by day and by night ſhall it paſs over you;</hi> that is, continually without any intermiſſion. Now theſe are the words I aim at, where he ſaith, <hi>And it ſhall be a vexation onely to hear the report.</hi> A vexation, that is, a torment, or a great
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170678:49"/> part of hell onely to underſtand the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that is, to underſtand the good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings that came into the world by Chriſts death for poor ſinners, and you will finde this to be verily the minde of the Spirit, if you compare it with Chap. 53. of <hi>Eſay</hi> verſe 1. where he ſpeaks of mens turning their backs upon the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Gods grace in the Goſpel, he ſaith, <hi>Who hath believed our report,</hi> or the Goſpel declared by us? Now this will be a mighty torment to the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they ſhall underſtand the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God was ſo great, that he even ſent his Son out of his boſome to die for ſinners, and yet that they ſhould be ſo fooliſh, as to put him off from one time to another; that they ſhould be ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, as to loſe heaven, and Chriſt, and eternall life in glory, for the ſociety of a company of drunkards; that they ſhould loſe their ſouls for a little ſport, for this world, for a ſtrumpet, for that which is lighter then vanity, and nothing. I ſay, this will be a very great torment unto thee.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another part of thy torment will be this, thou ſhalt ſee thy friends, thy acquaintance, thy neighbours; nay, it
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170678:50"/> may be thy father, thy mother, thy wife, thy husband, thy children, thy brother, thy ſiſter with others in the kingdom of heaven, and thy ſelf thruſt out. And this is that, that Chriſt told the Jews would befall them in <hi>Luke</hi> 13.28. <hi>There ſhall be weeping, &amp;c. when you ſhall ſee Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> (your father) <hi>and Iſaac, and Jacob,</hi> (together with your brethren) <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the kingdom of heaven, and your ſelves thruſt out.</hi> Nay, ſaith he, There ſhall come from the Eaſt, and from the Weſt, that is, thoſe that thou didſt never ſee in all thy life before, and they ſhall ſit down with thy friends, and thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, thy wife and thy children in the kingdom of heaven, and thou for thy ſins and diſobediencc ſhalt be ſhut, nay, thruſt out. O wonderfull tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, thou ſhalt have none but a company of damned ſouls, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable company of huge devils to keep company with thee. While thou art in this world, the very thoughts of the devils appearing to thee, makes thy fleſh to tremble, and thine hair ready to ſtand upright on thy head. But O what wilt thou do, when not onely the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170678:50"/> of the devils appearing, but the reall ſociety of all the devils in hell to be with thee howling and roaring, ſcreeching and yelling in ſuch a hideous manner, that thou wilt be even at thy wits end, and be ready to run ſtark madde again for anguiſh and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Again, that thou mighteſt be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to purpoſe, the mighty God of heaven will lay as great wrath and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon thee, as ever he can, by the might of his glorious power. As I ſaid before; Thou ſhalt have his wrath not by drops, no, but by whole ſhowres ſhall it come thunder, thunder upon thy body and ſoul ſo faſt, and ſo thick, that thou ſhalt be tormented out of meaſure. And ſo ſaith the Scripture. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9. ſpeaking of the wicked, <hi>Who ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his power, when the Saints ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring his gooodneſs and glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, this thou ſhalt have, as I ſaid before, without any intermiſſion, thou ſhalt not have any eaſe ſo long as while a man may turn himſelf round: thou ſhalt have it alwayes every hour, day
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170678:51"/> and night: for their worm never dies, but alwayes gnaws, and their fire is never quenched. As it is written in <hi>Mark</hi> 9.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Again, in this condition thou muſt be for ever, and that is as ſad as all the reſt. For if a man were to have all his ſins laid to his charge, and communion with the devils, and as much wrath as the great God of heaven can inflict upon them. I ſay, if it were but for a time, even ten thouſand years, if then it might have an end, there would be ground of comfort, and hopes of deliverance; but here is thy miſery, this is thy ſtate for ever, here thou muſt be for ever: when thou lookeſt about thee, and ſeeſt what an innumerable company of howling devils thou art amongſt, thou ſhalt think this again, this is my portion for ever. When thou haſt been in hell ſo many thouſand years as there are ſtars in the firmament, or drops in the ſea, or ſands on the ſea ſhore, yet thou haſt to lie there for ever. O this one word, ever, how will it torment thy ſoul. O friends, I have onely given a very ſhort touch of the torments of hell. O! I am ſet, I am ſet, and am not able to utter
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170678:51"/> what my minde conceives of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell. Yet this let me ſay to thee, accept of Gods mercy, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, leſt thou feel that with thy conſcience, which I cannot expreſſe with my tongue, and ſay, I am ſorely tormented in this flame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſeeth Abraham afar off, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus in his boſome.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the damned are in this pittiful ſtate, ſurrounded with fears, with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, with torment and vengeance; one thing they ſhall have, which is this, they ſhall ſee the happy and bleſſed ſtate of Gods children: he ſeeth <hi>Abraham</hi> afar off, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his boſome, which as I ſaid before, is the happy ſtate of the Saints, when this life is ended. This now ſhall be ſo far from being an eaſe unto them, that it ſhall moſt wonderfully ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate or heighten their torment, as I ſaid before. There ſhall be weeping, or cauſe of lamentation, when they ſhall ſee <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the kingdom of heaven, and themſelves thruſt out.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve, thoſe that die in their ſins are far from going to heaven. He ſeeth <hi>Abraham</hi> afar off, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170678:52"/> boſome. And indeed it is juſt with God to deal with them that die in their ſins, according to what they have done; and to make them who are far from righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs now, to ſtand far from heaven to all eternity. <hi>Hearken to this ye ſtout hearted, that are far from righteouſneſs,</hi> and that are reſolved to go on in your ſins; when you die, you will be far from heaven; you will ſee <hi>Lazarus,</hi> but it will be afar off. Again, <hi>he ſeeth Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham afar off, and Lazarus in his boſome.</hi> Theſe are ſome of the things that the damned do behold, ſo ſoon as they come into torment. Mark, <hi>And he ſeeth La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus in Abrahams boſome. Lazarus,</hi> who was he? Why, even he that was ſo flighted, ſo diſregaded, ſo undervalued by this ungodly one while he was in the world; he ſeeth <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
               <p>From whence obſerve, That thoſe who live and the die enemies of the Saints of God; let them be never ſo great or ſtout; let them bear never ſo much ſway while they are in the world; let them brag and boaſt never ſo much while they are here, they ſhall in ſpight of their teeths ſee the Saints, yea, the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170678:52"/> poor Saints, even the <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s, or the ragged ones that belong to Jeſus, to be in a better condition then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. O who do you think was in the beſt condition, or who do you think ſaw themſelves in the beſt condition, he that was in hell, or he that was in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? He that was in darkneſs, or he that was in light? He that was in everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joy, or he that was in everlaſting torments? The one with God, Chriſt, Saints, Angels: the other in torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flames, under the curſe of Gods eternal hatred, with the devils and their angels, together with an innumerable company of howling, roaring, curſing, ever burning reprobates. Certainly this obſervation will be eaſily proved to be true here in this world, by him that looks upon it with an underſtanding heart, and will clear it ſelf to be true in the world to come, by ſuch as ſhall go either to heaven or to hell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond obſervation from theſe words, <hi>And ſeeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his boſome,</hi> is this, They that are the perſecutours of the Saints of the Lord now in this world, ſhall ſee the Lords perſecuted ones, to be they that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170678:53"/> are ſo highly eſteemed by the Lord, as to ſit, or to be in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome (in everlaſting glory) though they, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the children of God, and the practice of the Saints did ſo lightly eſteem them, that they ſcorn to let them gather up the dogs meat that falls under their table; this is alſo verified and held forth plainly by this Parable. And therefore be not grieved, O you that are the tempted, perſecuted, afflicted, ſighing, praying Saints of the Lord, though your adverſaries look upon you now with a diſdainful, ſurly, rugged, proud and haughty countenance, yet the time ſhall come, when they ſhall ſpie you in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome.</p>
               <p>I might enlarge upon theſe things, but ſhall leave them to the Spirit of the Lord, which can better by ten thouſand degrees enlarge them on thy heart and conſcience; then I can upon a piece of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Therefore leaving theſe to the bleſſing of the Lord, I ſhall come to the next verſe, and ſhall be brief in ſpeaking to that alſo, and ſo paſs to the reſt.</p>

               <p>From theſe words, <hi>and he cried,</hi> we may obſerve, firſt, what a change the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly will have, when they come into hell. Where he ſaith, he cried; it is like he was laughing, jeſting, jearing, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, mocking, ſwearing, curſing, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, perſecuting of the godly in his proſperity, among his filthy compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170678:54"/> but now the caſe is otherwiſe; now he is inanother frame; now his proud, ſtout, curriſh carriage is come down, as is clearly ſignified by theſe words, <hi>And he cried.</hi> Therefore by theſe words you may ſecondy obſerve, that the laughter of the ungodly will not laſt alwayes, but will be ſure to end in a cry. O no my friends, conſider, you muſt have a change either here or in hell. If you be not new creatures, regenerate perſons, new born babes in this world before you go hence, your note will be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, you. conditions will be changed: for if you come into hell, you muſt cry. O did but the ſinging drunkards, when they are making merry on the Alebench think on this, that if they drop into hell they muſt cry, it would make them change their note, and cry, What ſhall I do, whither ſhal I go when I die? But as I ſaid before, the devil, as he labors to get poor ſouls to follow their ſins, ſo he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors alſo to keep the thoughts of eternal damnation out of their mindes; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe two things are ſo nearly linked together, that the devil cannot well get the ſoul to go on in ſin with delight, unleſs he can keep the thougths
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170678:54"/> of that terrible after-clap out of their mindes. But let them know that it ſhall not alwayes be thus with them; for if when they depart, they drop down into eternal deſtruction, they ſhall have ſuch a ſence of their ſins, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to the ſame, that it ſhall make them to cry. <hi>And he cried.</hi> O what an alteration will there be among the ungodly, when they go out of this world! it may be a fortnight or a moneth before their departure, they were light, ſtout, ſurly, drinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves drunk, ſlighting Gods people, mocking at goodneſs, and delighting in ſin; following the world, ſeeking after riches, faring deliciouſly, keeping com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the braveſt; but now they are dropt down into hell, they cry. A little while ago they were painting their faces, feeding their luſts, following their whores, robbing their neighbours, telling of lies, following of playes, and ſports to paſs away the time; but now they are in hell they do cry. It may be laſt year they heard ſome good ſermons, was invited to receive heaven, was told their ſins ſhould be pardoned, if they cloſed in with Jeſus; but refuſing his
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170678:55"/> profers, and ſlighting the grace that was once tendered, they are now in hell, and do cry.</p>
               <p>Before they had ſo much time (they thought) that they could not tell how to ſpend it, unleſs it were in hunting, and whoring, in dancing and playing, and ſpending whole hours; yea, dayes, nay weeks in the luſts of the fleſh, but when they depart into another place, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to lift up their eyes in hell, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their miſerable, and irrecoverable condition they will cry.</p>
               <p>O what a condition wilt thou fall into, when thou doſt depart this world, if thou depart unconverted, and not born again, thou hadſt better have been ſmothered the firſt hour thou waſt born; thou hadſt better have been plucked one limb from another; thou hadſt bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have been made a dog, a toad, a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; nay, any other creature in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible world, then to die unconverted, and this thou wilt finde to be true, when <hi>in hell thou doſt lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:170678:56"/>8. They will cry to think, that <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> whom once they ſlighted, muſt be of them that muſt ſit with Chriſt to judge, or together with Chriſt, to paſs a ſentence of condemnation on their ſouls for ever and ever, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 6.2, 3.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Cry to think, that when the judgement is over, and others are taken into the everlaſting kingdom of glory, then thou muſt depart back again into that dungeon of darkneſs, from whence thou cameſt our, (to appear before that terrible tribunal) where thou ſhalt be tormented ſo long as eternity laſts, without the leaſt intermiſſion or eaſe. How ſayeſt thou, O thou wanton, proud, ſwearing, lying ungodly wretch, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be to be ſlighted, and made a mock at. And again, tell me now, if it be not better to leave ſin, and to cloſe in with Chriſt Jeſus, notwithſtanding that reproach thou ſhalt meet with for ſo doing; then to live a little while in this world in pleaſures, and feeding thy luſts, in neglecting the welfare of thy ſoul, and refuſing to be juſtified by Jeſus, and in a moment to drop down to hell, and to cry? O conſider, I ſay
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170678:56"/> conſider betimes, and put not off the the tenders of the grace of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, leſt you lift up your eyes in hell, and cry for anguiſh of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he cried, and ſaid, Father Abraham have mercy upon me, and ſend Lazarus, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words do not onely hold forth the lamentable condition of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and their lamentable howling and crying out under their anguiſh of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but alſo they do ſignifie to us (as I ſaid before) their too late repentance; and alſo that they would very willingly if they might, be ſet at liberty from that everlaſting miſery, that by their ſins they have plunged themſelves into. I ſay, theſe words do hold forth a deſire that the damned have to be delivered from thoſe torments that they now are in: <hi>O Father Abraham,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have mercy upon me, and ſend Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.</hi> Theſe words, Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> may have ſome difficulty in them. It is poſſible, that ſome may think them to be meant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and thoſe; or him that crieth out here, to be the Jews.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170678:57"/> Or it may be ſome may underſtand it to be God, or Jeſus Chriſt his Son, which I rather ſuppoſe it may be, that is here cried out unto, becauſe you finde the ſame cry to him, as it were uttered by the ungodly in other places of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 13. verſe 25, 26. <hi>Then ſhall they ſay, Lord, Lord, we have eat and drunk in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets.</hi> Nay more, <hi>In thy Name have we caſt out devils, and in thy Name done many wonderfull works.</hi> This was juſt at their rejection. And again in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.11. They cry again to him, even to Jeſus. <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us.</hi> And he there again gives them a repulſe, as alſo in this Parable. But however, or whoſoever <hi>Abraham</hi> is, yet theſe truths may be obſerved from the words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the damned, when in an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable eſtate, will ſeek for, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire deliverance from the wrath that they are, and ſhall be in for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they will pray (if I may ſo call it) earneſtly for deliverance from their miſerable eſtate. Theſe two things are clear from the words. For mark, He not onely ſaid, <hi>Father Abraham have
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170678:57"/> mercy upon me.</hi> But he cried and ſaid, <hi>Father Abraham have mercy on me.</hi> From whence take a third obſervation, and that is, There is a time comming, wherein though men ſhall both cry and pray, yet they are like to have no mercy at the hands of God; for ſo was this man ſerved, as I ſhall further ſhew by and by when I come to it.</p>
               <p>Some people are ſo deluded by the devil, as to think that God is ſo merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as to own or regard any thing for prayer; they think any thing will go for currant and good ſatisfaction, while they are here in this world, through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the true nature of the mercy of God, and the knowledge in what way God is ſatisfied for ſinners. Now I ſay, through ignorance they think, that if they do but mutter over ſome form of prayers, though they know not what they ſay, nor what they requeſt, yet God is ſatisfied, yea, very well ſatisfied with their doings; when alas! there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe. O friends, I beſeech you to look about you, and ſeek in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt for the Spirit of Chriſt, ſo to help you now, to ſtrive and pray, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able you to lay hold of Chriſt, that your
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170678:58"/> ſouls may be ſaved, leſt the time come, that though you cry and pray, and wiſh alſo that you had laid hold on the Lord Jeſus, yet you muſt, and ſhall be damned.</p>
               <p>Then again, you may ſee that though God be willing to ſave ſinners at ſome time, yet this time doth not alwayes laſt: No, he that can finde in his heart to turn his back upon Jeſus Chriſt now, ſhall have the back turned upon him hereafter, when he may cry and pray for mercy, and yet go without it. God will have a time to meet with them that now do ſeek after him: they ſhall have a time, yea, time enough hereafter to repent their folly, and to befool them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for turning their backs upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, this ſhould admoniſh us to take time while it is profered, leſt we repent us of our unbelief and rebellion, when we are deprived of it. Ah friends! time is precious, an hours time to hear a ſermon is precious; I have ſometimes thought thus with my ſelf. Set the caſe the Lord ſhould ſend two or three of his ſervants the Miniſters of the Goſpel to hell among the damned
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170678:58"/> with this Commiſſion; Go ye to Hell and preach my grace to thoſe that are there: let your Sermon be an hour long, and hold forth the merits of my Sons birth, righteouſneſs, death, reſurrection, aſcenſion, and interceſſion with all my love in him, and proffer it to them, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them that now once more, and but once, do I profer the means of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to them. They who are now roaring, being paſt hope would then leap at the leaſt proffer of mercy: Oh they that could ſpend whole dayes, weeks, nay years, in rejecting the Son of God, would now be glad of one tender of that mercy. Father ſaith he, have mercy on me.</p>
               <p>Again, from theſe words you may obſerve, that mercy will be welcome when ſouls are under judgement; now his ſoul is in the fire, now he is under the wrath of God, now he is in Hell, there to be tormented, now he is with the devills and damned ſpirits, now he feels the vengeance of God: now, Oh, now have mercy on me. Here you may ſee again that mercy is prized by them that are in Hell, they would be glad if they could have it. Father, have mercy
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170678:59"/> on me. For my poor ſouls ſake ſend me a little mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſend Lazarus, that he may dip th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words do not onely hold forth that the ungodly have a deſire of mercy, but what thoſe mercies are that theſe poor creatures would be glad of.</p>
               <p>As firſt, To have the company of a <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> granted to them. <hi>Father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham have mercy upon me, and ſend Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> Now <hi>Lazarus</hi> was he that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God and alſo he that was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve, that thoſe Saints that the world in their life-time could not indure, now they are departed they would be glad to have ſociety with them. O now ſend <hi>Lazarus,</hi> though the time was when I cared not for him, yet now let me have ſome ſociety with him.</p>
               <p>Though the world diſregard the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of God children now, yet there is a time coming in which they would be glad to have the leaſt company with them. Nay do but obſerve, thoſe of the Saints that are now moſt rejected by them, even from them ſhall they be glad of comfort, if it might be. Send <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:170678:59"/> he that I ſlighted more then my dogs, he that I could not endure ſhould come into my houſe, but muſt lye at my gate, ſend him: Now <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhall be welcome to me, now do I deſire ſome comfort from him; but he ſhall go without it.</p>
               <p>From whence again obſerve, that there is a time coming, O ye ſurly dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged perſecutors of the Saints, that they ſhall ſlight you as much as ever you ſlighted them. You have given them many an hard word, told many a lie of them, given them many a blow: And now in your greateſt need and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity they ſhall not pitty you.</p>
               <p>Again, ſend <hi>Lazarus.</hi> From whence obſerve, that any of the Saints ſhall then be owned by you to be Saints. Now ye look upon them to be of the ſect with <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> but then you ſhall ſee them to be the <hi>Lazarus's</hi> of God, even Gods dear children. Though now the Saints of the Lord will not be owned by you, becauſe they are begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, poor, low, contemptible among you here, yet the day is coming that you ſhall own them, deſire their company, and wiſh for the leaſt courteſie from them.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:170678:60"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Send</hi> Lazarus <hi>that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus ſhall the ſouls that abide in their ſins cry out in the bitterneſs of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits with wonderful anguiſh &amp; torment of conſcience, without intermiſſion; <hi>that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue.</hi> That he, namely, the man who before I ſcorned ſhould eat with the dogs of my flock, that before I ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and had no regard of, that I ſhut out of door, ſend him, <hi>that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue.</hi> Now theſe words, <hi>that he may dip the tip of his finger in water,</hi> &amp;c. do hold forth the leaſt friendſhip, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; as much as if he ſhould have ſaid, Father now I would be glad of the leaſt mercie, now I would be glad of the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſt comfort, though it be but one drop of cold water on the tip of his finger. One would have thought that this had been a ſmall requeſt, a ſmall courteſie, one drop of water, what is that? Take a pail full of it, if that will do the any good. But mark, he is not permitted to have ſo much as one drop, not ſo much as a man may hold upon the tip
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170678:60"/> of his finger. This ſignifies thus much, that they that fall ſhort of Chriſt, ſhall be night and day tormented from years end, to years end, as I may ſay, even as long as eternity laſteth, and ſhall not have ſo much as the leaſt eaſe, no not ſo long as while a man may turn himſelf round, not ſo much leave as to ſwallow his ſpittle, not a drop of cold water.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again conſider, that though the rebels while they are in this world can turne their backs upon the greateſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, namely the Grace of God in Chriſt; yet the time will come that they would be glad of the leaſt mercy even a drop of cold water.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again obſerve, that thoſe who in their life time do turn their back upon the ſtreams of Gods grace and love, when they depart this life, they ſhall not have the priviledge of the leaſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, though they would never ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly. O that theſe things did take place in your hearts, how would it make you to ſeek after reſt for your ſouls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be too late, before the ſun of the Goſpel be ſet upon you. Conſider, I ſay, the miſery of the ungodly that they ſhall be in, and avoid their vices by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170678:61"/> cloſing in with the tenders of mercy; leſt you partake of the ſame portion with them, and cry out in the bitterneſs of your ſouls, one drop of cold water and cool my tongue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For I am tormented in this flame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words hold forth the reaſon why the damned do ſo much requeſt there might be ſome pitty ſhewed to them; namely becauſe they are under ſore and ſad affliction; for I am tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this flame. Indeed the reaſon why the poor world do not ſo earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for mercy is, partly becauſe they do not ſo ſeriouſly conſider the torment that they muſt certainly fall into if they die out of Chriſt. For let me tell you, did but poor ſouls indeed conſider that wrath that doth by right fall to their ſhares becauſe of their ſins againſt God, they would make more haſte to God through Chriſt for mercy then they do. Then we ſhould have them ſay, it is good cloſing with Chriſt to day before we fall into ſuch diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>But why is it ſaid, <hi>Let him dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue?</hi> Becauſe that as the ſeveral members in the bodie have their ſhare
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170678:61"/> in ſin, and committing of that, ſo the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral members and every member of the body, ſhall at that time be puniſhed for the ſame. Therefore when Chriſt is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing his deſciples, that they ſhould not turne aſide from him; and that they ſhould rather fear and dread the power of their God then any other power, he ſaith, <hi>Fear him therefore, that can caſt both body and ſoul into hell.</hi> And again; <hi>fear him that can deſtroy both ſoul and hody in hell.</hi> Here is not one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber onely, <hi>but all the body,</hi> the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of which the hands, feet, eyes, eares, and tongue are members. And I am perſwaded, that though this may be judged carnal by ſome now, yet it will appear to be a truth then to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miſery of thoſe who ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to undergo, that which God in his juſt judgement ſhall inflict upon them. O then they will cry, one dram of eaſe for my curſing, ſwearing, lying, jearing tongue. Some eaſe for my bragging, braving, flattering, threatning, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling tongue, now men can let their tongues run at randome, as we uſe to ſay, now they will be apt to ſay our tongues are our own; who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trole
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170678:62"/> them? But then they will be in another mind. Then O that I might have a little eaſe for my deceitful tongue.</p>
               <p>Methinks ſometimes to conſider how ſome men do let their tongues run at randome, they cannot tell well how, it makes me marvell. Surely, they do not think they ſhall be made to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for their offending with their tongue. Did they but think they ſhall be made to give an account to him who is ready to judge the quick and the dead, ſurely they would be more wary of, and have more regard unto their tongue.</p>
               <p>The tongue ſaith <hi>James</hi> is<note n="*" place="margin">Jam. 2.</note> an unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly member full of deadly poiſon, it ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on fire the whole frame of nature, and is ſet on fire of hell. The tongue, how much miſchief will it ſtir up in a very little time? How many blows and wounds doth it cauſe? How many times doth it (as <hi>James</hi> ſaith) curſe man? How oft is the tongue made the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer of that helliſh poyſon that is in the heart, both to the diſhonour of God, the hurt of its neighbours, and the utter ruine of its own ſoul? And do you think that the Lord will ſit ſtill (as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170678:62"/> I may ſay) and let thy tongue run as it liſts,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 25.</note> and yet never bring you to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the ſame? No ſtay; the Lord will not alwayes keep ſilence,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21.</note> but will reprove thee, and ſet thy ſinnes in order before thine eyes, O ſinner. Yea and thy tongue, together with the reſt of thy members, ſhall be tormented for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And I ſay, I am very confident, that though this be made light of now, yet the time is coming when many poor ſouls will rue the day that ever they did ſpeak with a tongue, will one ſay that I ſhould ſo diſregard my tongue. O that I when I ſaid ſo and ſo had before bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten off my tongue! that I had been born without a tongue! my tongue, my tongue, a little water to cool my tongue for I am tormented in this flame; even that flame that my tongue, together with the reſt of my members, by ſinning have brought me to. Poor ſouls now will let their tongues ſay any thing for a little profit, for two pence or three-pence gain. But O what a grief will this be at that day when they together with their tongue muſt ſmart for that which they by their tongues have done while they were in this world. Then
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170678:63"/> you that love your ſouls look to your tongues, leſt you bind your ſelves down ſo faſt to hell with the ſins of your tongues, that you will never be able to get looſe again to all eternity.<note place="margin">Jam. 1.26.</note> For by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned if thou have not a care of thy tongue.</p>

               <p>From theſe words you ſee this is to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170678:66"/> be obſerved, that the ungodly ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, or have in remembrance the miſpending their lives, and that I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from theſe words, <hi>Remember that in thy life time thou hadſt thy good things.</hi> You may take theſe words <hi>good things</hi> either ſimply, for the things of this world, which in themſelves are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and may be called good things, or elſe with theſe words, namely, (the things <hi>of this life</hi>) all the pleaſures, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, profits, and vanities, which the ignorant people of the world do count their good things, and do very much cheer themſelves therewith. <hi>Soul, ſoul, eat, drink and be merry, for thou haſt much goods laid up for many years. Luke</hi> 12.20. Now I ſay, God according to his glorious power and wiſdome will make poor creatures have alwayes in their minds a freſh and clear remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their ill ſpent life; he will ſay unto them, <hi>Remember, remember that in thy life time, it was thus and thus with thee, and in thy life time thy carriage was ſo and ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is like that if ſinners might have their choice, they would not have their ſins and tranſgreſſions ſo much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170678:66"/> as is evident by their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages here in this world: for here they will not endure to entertain a ſerious thought of their filthy life, but will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by all means to put the thought of it out of their mind: but there they ſhall be made to remember to a purpoſe, and to think continually of their ungodly deeds. And therefore it is ſaid that when our Lord Jeſus comes to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will be to convince the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly world of their wicked and ungodly deeds. Mark, <hi>To convince them. Jude</hi> 14, 15. It is like they will not willingly take notice of them: But they ſhall be convinced of them in ſpite of their teeth. And alſo between this and them, theſe that die out of Chriſt ſhall be made to ſee, acknowledge, and confeſs, do what they can, when they lift up their eyes in hell, and to remember their tranſgreſſions. God will be a <hi>ſwift wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt them. Mat.</hi> 3.5. and will ſay, Remember what thou didſt in thy life time, how thou didſt live in thy life time.

               <p>The great God in ſtead of giving the ungodly any eaſe, will even aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate their torments, firſt, by ſlighting their perplexities.

That Scripture was not written in vain, It is like the crackling of thorns under a pot make a litle blaze for a ſudden, a little heat for a while, but come and conſider them by and by, and inſtead of a comfortable heat, you will find nothing but a few dead aſhes; and inſtead of a flaming fire, nothing but a ſmell of ſmoak.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again obſerve that there is a time coming that the ungodly would be glad of a better portion, when they ſhall ſee the vanity of this; that is, when they ſhall ſee what a poor thing it is for a man to have his portion in this world.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170678:68"/> makes them cry out, Who will ſhew us any good, that is comparable to the pleaſures, profits, and glory of this world? but then they will ſee there is another thing that is better, and of more value then ten thouſand worlds.

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things therefore betimes, leſt thou have thy portion in thy life time. For if in this life onely we have our portion, we are of all people the moſt miſerable. Again conſider, that when other men (the Saints) are to receive their good things, then thou haſt had thine: when others are to enter into joy, then thou art to leave and depart from thy joy: when others are to go to God, thou muſt go to the devil. Oh miſerable! thou hadſt better thou hadſt never been born then to be an heir of ſuch a portion, therefore I ſay have a care it be not thy condition.</p>

               <p>From whence obſerve. 1. That the life of the Saints ſo long as they are in this world, is attended with many evils or afflictions, which may be diſcovered to be of divers natures, as ſaith the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. <hi>Many are the troubles of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous but the Lord delivereth him out of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Take notice, that the afflictions, or evils, that accompany the Saints, may continue with them their life time, ſo long as they live in this vale of tears; yea, and they may be divers, that is, of ſeveral ſorts; ſome outward, ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and that as long as they ſhall continue here below, as hath been the experience of all Saints in all ages, and this might be proved at large, but I one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hint in theſe things, although I might enlarge much upon them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The evils that do accompany the Saints will continue with them no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then their life time; and here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed lies the comfort of Believers, the <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s, the Saints, they muſt have all
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170678:69"/> their bitter cup wrung out to them in their life time: here muſt be all their trouble, here muſt be all their grief. Behold, ſaith Chriſt, the world ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, but you ſhall lament; but your mourning ſhall, mark, it ſhall be turned into joy; you ſhall lament, you ſhall be ſorrowful, you ſhall weep in you life time, but your ſorrow ſhall be tur-turned into joy, and your joy no man (let him be what he will, no man) ſhall take away from you. Now if you think, when I ſay the Saints have all their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil things in their life time, that I mean they have nothing elſe but trouble in this their life time, this is your miſtake: for let me tell you, that though the Saints have all their evil things in their life time, yet even in their life time they have alſo joy unſpeakable and full of glory,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.6, 7, 8.</note> while they look not at the things that are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen. The joy that the Saints have ſometimes in their hearts by a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving conſideration of the good things to come when this life is ended, doth fill them fuller of joy then all the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, troubles, temptations, and evils that accompany them in this life can fill

               <p>But my trouble is, I am perplexed with an heart full of corruption &amp; ſin, ſo that I am much hindred in walking with God</p>

               <p>I ſay, be what thou wilt, if thou be found in unbelief, or under the firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant thou art ſure to ſmart for it at the time when thou doſt depart this world? But the thing to be lamented is this: For all this is ſo ſad a condition to be fallen into, yet poor ſouls are for the moſt part ſenſeleſs of it, yea, ſo ſenſeleſs at ſometimes, as though there was no ſuch miſery to come hereafter. Becauſe the Lord doth not immediately ſtrike with his ſword, but doth bear long with his creature, waiting that he might be gracious, therefore I ſay the hearts of ſome of the ſonnes of men, are wholly ſet upon it to do miſchief:<note place="margin">Eccleſ.</note> And that forbearance and goodneſs of God, that one would think ſhould lead them to repentance; the devil harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The verſe I laſt ſpake to was, and is a very terrible one, and aggravates the torments of poor ſinners wonderfully. Where he ſaith, <hi>Remember that thou in thy ife time hadſt thy good things, and Lazarus his evil things, but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented,</hi> I ſay theſe words are very terrible to thoſe poor ſouls that die out of Chriſt. But theſe latter words do much more hold out their ſorrow. They were ſpoken as to the preſent condition then upon the ſinner, theſe do not onely back the former but do yet further aggravate their miſery, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forth that which will be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable; the former verſe is enough to ſmite any ſinner into a ſwound, but this to make him fall down dead. Where he ſaith, And beſides all this, there is ſtill ſomething to aggravate thy miſery yet far more abundantly, I ſhall briefly ſpeak to the words, as they have relation to the terrour ſpoken of in the verſes before. As if he had ſaid, Thou

As if he ſhould ſay, O tis true, thou art now deprived of a being in the world, thou art deprived of hearing the Goſpel, the devil hath been too hard for thee, and hath made thee miſs of heaven: thou art now in hell among an innumerable company of devils, and all thy ſins beſet thee round, thou art all over wrapped in flames, and canſt not have one drop of water to give the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

'Tis true I ſpeak enough before to break thine heart aſu der, <hi>But beſides all this,</hi> there lie and ſwim in flame for ever: theſe words, <hi>Beſides all this,</hi> are terrible words indeed. I will give you the ſcope of them in a ſimilitude. Set caſe you ſhould take a man, and tie him to a ſtake, and with red hot Pincers, pinch off his fleſh by little pieces for two or three years together, and at laſt, when the poor man cryes out for eaſe and help, the tormentors anſwer, Nay, but beſides all this, you muſt be handled worſe. We will ſerve you thus theſe 20. years together, and after that we will fill your mangled body full of ſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding lead, and run you through with a red hot ſpit, would not this be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table? yet this is but a flea-biting to the ſorrows of theſe that go to hell; for if a man were ſerved ſo, there would ere it were long be an end of him. But he that goes to hell ſhall ſuffer ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times worſe torments then theſe,

Oh, thou that wert loath to foul thy foot if it were but durty, or did but rain; thou that wert loath to come out of the chimney corner if the winde did but blow a little cold; and wert loath to go half a mile, yea half a furlong to hear the word of God, if it were but a little dark; thou that wert loath to leave a few vain companions to edifie thy ſoul: thou ſhalt have fire enough, thou ſhalt have night enough, and evil company enough, thy belly full if thou miſs of Jeſus Chriſt; and <hi>beſides all this,</hi> thou ſhalt have them for ever and for ever.</p>

               <p>O thou that doſt ſpend whole nights in carding and dicing, in rioting and wantonneſs, thou that counteſt it a brave thing to ſwear as faſt as the braveſt, to ſpend with the greateſt ſpend-thrift (as we call them) in the countrey: O thou that loveſt to ſin in a corner when no body ſees thee! O thou that for by-ends doſt carry on an hypocrites profeſſion, becauſe thou wouldeſt be counted ſome body among the children of God, but art an enemy to the things of Chriſt in thine heart: thou that doſt ſatisfie thy ſelf, either with ſins, or a bare profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of godlineſs; thy ſoul will fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to extreme torment, and anguiſh ſo ſoon as ever thou doſt depart this world, and there thou ſhalt be weeping and gnaſhing thy teeth. <hi>And beſides all this,</hi> thou art like never to have any eaſe or remedy, never look for any deliverance, if thou die out of Chriſt; thou ſhalt die in thy ſins; and be tormented as many years as there are ſtars in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſands on the ſea-ſhore; <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this,</hi> thou muſt abide it for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And beſides al this between us &amp; you there is a great gulf fixed, ſo that they which would
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170678:75"/> paſs from hence to you cannot, neither can they come to us that would come from thence. There is a great gulf fixed.]</hi> You will ſay what is that? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a nice queſtion, therefore, firſt ſeek thou, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to enter in at the ſtraight, gate than curiouſly to enquire what this gulf is. But 2. if thou wouldeſt needs know, it is like that if thou do fall ſhort of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thou wilt find it this; namely, the everlaſting decree of God, that is, that there is a decree gone forth from God, that thoſe who fall ſhort of heaven in this world, God is reſolved they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enjoy it in the world to come. And thou wilt find this gulf ſo deep, that thou ſhalt never be able to wade through it as long as eternity laſts. As Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Agree with thine adverſary quickly, while thou art in the way with him, leſt he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be caſt into priſon; I tell thee, thou ſhalt in no wiſe come out thence</hi> (there is the gulf) <hi>the decree; thou ſhalt not depart thence, till thou haſt paid the uttermoſt farthing,</hi> or very <hi>last mite,</hi> Luk. 12.58, 59. Theſe words therefore, <hi>there is a great gulf fixed,</hi> I do underſtand to be the everlaſting decree of God; that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170678:75"/> is, God hath decreed, that thoſe who go to heaven ſhall never go from thence again into a worſe place; and alſo thoſe that go to hell, and would come out, they ſhall not come out thence again. And friend this is ſuch a gulf, ſo fixed by him that cannot lie, that thou wilt find it ſo which way ſoever thou goeſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be to heaven or hell. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ſeeſt how ſecure God will make thoſe who dye in the faith; God will keep them in heaven, but thoſe that die in their ſins, God will throw them to hell and keep them there; ſo that they that would go from heaven to hell can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, neither can they come from hell that would go to heaven. Mark, he doth not ſay, they would not; for oh how fain would theſe who have loſt their ſouls for a luſt, for two pence, for a jug of Ale for a ſtrumpet, for this world; come out of that hot ſcalding fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of Gods eternal vengeance, if they might; but here is their miſery, they that would come from you to us, that is, from hell to heaven, cannot. They muſt not, they ſhall not, they cannot, God hath decreed it, and is reſolved the contrary, here therefore lies the miſery,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170678:76"/> not ſo much that they are in hell, if they might come out again; but there they muſt lie for ever and ever. O therefore if thy heart would at any time tempt thee to ſin againſt God, cry out, O no, for then I muſt go to hell and lie there for ever. O if the drunkards, ſwearers, lyars, and hypocrites did but take this doctrine ſoundly down, it would make them tremble when they think of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. But poor ſouls, <hi>now they will make a mock at ſinne,</hi> and play with it as a child doth play with a rattle; but the time is coming that theſe rattles that now they play with, will make ſuch a noiſe in their ears and conſciences one day, that they ſhall find, that if all the devils in hell were yelling at their heels, the noiſe would not be compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it. <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.23. O friend, thy ſins, as ſo many blood-hounds will firſt hunt thee out, and then take thee, and bind thee, and hold thee down for ever, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.22. They will gripe thee and gnaw thee as if thou hadſt a neſt of poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Serpents in thy bowels, and this will not be for a time, but as I have ſaid, for ever, for ever, for ever.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do believe there is ſcarce ſo much love in any of the damned in hell, as really to deſire the ſalvation of any; it would ſeem ſtrange to me, that ſuch a quality ſhould be found in any there, as out of ſingleneſs of heart, to deſire the ſalvation of their neighbours, out of love to them. But in that there is any deſire in them that are damned, that their friends and relations ſhould not come into that place of torment. It appears to me to be rather for their own eaſe then for their neighbours good; for let me tell you, this I do believe, that it will aggravate or heighten the grief and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of them, to ſee their ungodly neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in the like deſtruction with them: For where the ungodly do live, and die, and deſcend into the pit together, the one is rather a vexation to the other, then any thing elſe. And it muſt needs be ſo, becauſe there are no ungodly people, that do live ungodly together, but they do learn ill examples one of another, as thus. If there live one in the town that is very expert and cunning for the world, why now the reſt of his neighbours that are of the ſame mind with him, they will labour to imitate him and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170678:82"/> his ſteps: this is commonly ſeen. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if there be one given to drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, others of the town through his means, run the more into that ſin with him, &amp; do accuſtom themſelves the more unto it, becauſe of his inticing them, and alſo byſetting ſuch an ill example before them. And ſo if there be any addicted to pride, &amp; muſt needs be in all the neweſt faſhions, how do their example provoke other to love and follow the ſame vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſpending that upon their luſts which ſhould relieve their own and others wants. Alſo if there be any given to jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſcoffing, lying, whoring, backbiting, junketting, wantonneſs, or any other ſin; they that are moſt expert in theſe things do oft-times intangle others that peradventure would not have been ſo vile as now they are, had they not had ſuch an example. Now theſe will by their doings exceedingly aggravate the condemnation of one another, as thus. He that did ſet his neighbour an ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and thereby cauſed him to walk in ſin: He will be found one cauſe of his and his friends deſtruction, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he will have to anſwer for his own ſins, and for a great part of his neighbours too, which will ſtill adde to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170678:83"/> his deſtruction: as that Scripture in <hi>Ezek.</hi> ſheweth, where ſpeaking of the watchman that ſhould give the people warning, if he did not, though the man did die in his ſins, yet his blood ſhould be required at the watchmans hand, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. So here let me tell thee, that if thou ſhouldeſt be ſuch an one, as by thy converſation and practices, ſhalt be a trap and a ſtumbling-block to cauſe thy neighbour to fall into eternal ruine, though he be damned for his own ſin; yet God may, nay, he will charge thee as being guilty of his blood, in that thou didſt not content thy ſelf to keep from heaven thy ſelf, but didſt alſo by thy fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy converſation keep away others alſo, &amp; cauſe them to fall with thee. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, will not this aggravate thy tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Yea, if thou ſhouldeſt die, and go to hell before thy neighbour or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, beſides the guilt of thine own ſins, thou wouldeſt be ſo loaden with the fear of the damnation of others to be laid to thy charge, that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt cry out; <hi>O ſend one from the dead to this companion, and that companion, with whom I had ſociety in my life time, for I ſee my curſed carriage will be one cauſe of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170678:83"/> his condemnation, if he fall ſhort of glory.</hi> It is true, I left him living in foul and hainous offences: But I was one of the firſt inſtruments to bring him to them. Oh, I ſhall be guilty both of mine own and his damnation too! that he might be kept out hence leſt my torment be aggravated by his comming hither.</p>
               <p>For as I ſaid before, where ungodly people do dwell together, they being a ſnare and ſtumbling-block one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other by their practices, they muſt needs be a torment one to another, and an aggravation of each others damnation. O curſed be thy face, ſaith one, that ever I ſet mine eyes on thee: It was long of thee; I may thank the; it was thee that did intice me, and enſnare me; it was your filthy converſation that was as a ſtumbling-block to me, it was your covetouſneſs, it was your pride, your haunting the Alehouſe, your gaming and whoring, it was long o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170678:84"/> O that thou hadſt never been born! to do my ſoul this wrong as you have done: O ſaith the other, And I may as much blame you, for do not you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how at ſuch a time, and at ſuch a time, you drew me out, and drew me away, and asked me if I would go with you, when I was going about other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, about my calling; but you called me away, you ſent for me, you are as much in the fault as I, though I were covetous, you were proud; and if you learned covetouſneſs of me,<note n="*" place="margin">This language is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heard at the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, but for ought that I can learn, it is more to be heard in hell.</note> I lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned pride and drunkenneſs of you; though I learned you to cheat, you learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to whore, to lye, to ſcoff at good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Though I baſe wretch did ſtumble you in ſome things, yet you did as much ſtumble me in others. I can blame you as you blame me; and if I have to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for ſome of your moſt filthy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you have to anſwer for ſome of mine. I would you had not come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the very looks of you doth wound my ſoul, by bringing my ſins afreſh into my mind, the time when, the manner how, the place where, the perſons with whom: it was with you, you! grief to my ſoul! ſince I could not ſhun thy

               <p>I ſay therefore for theſe that have ſinned together, to go to hell together, it will very much perplex and torment them both. Therefore I judge this is one reaſon why they that are in hell do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that their friends, or companions do not come thither into the ſame place of torment that they are in. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where Chriſt ſaith, that theſe dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſouls cry out, <hi>Send to our companions, that they may be warned and commanded to look to themſelves. O ſend to my five brethren;</hi> it is becauſe they would not have their own torments heightned by their company; and a ſenſe, yea, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſenſe of their ſins which they did cauſe them to commit, when they were in the world with them. For I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the very looks of thoſe that have been beguiled by their fellows, I ſay, their very looks will be a torment to them: for thereby will the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their own ſins be kept (if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) the freſher on their conſciences, which they committed with them, and alſo they will wonderfully have the guilt of the others ſins upon them, in

But if they do fall into the ſame place where I am, the ſins that I have cauſed them to commit will lie ſo heavy, not only on their ſouls but alſo on mine, that they will be enough to ſink me into eternal miſery deeper and deeper. <hi>O therefore, ſend him to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, to my five brethren, and let him teſtifie to them leſt they come into this place of torment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words being thus underſtood. What a condition doth it ſhew them to be in then, that now ſo much delight in being the very ring-leaders of their companions into ſins of all ſorts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <p>Now while men live here, if they can be counted the cunningeſt in cheating, the boldeſt for lying, the archeſt for
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170678:85"/> whoring, the ſubtilleſt for coveting, and getting the world: Now if men can but cunningly defraud, undermine, croſs, and anger their neighbours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, and hinder their neighbours from the means of Grace, the Goſpel of Chriſt; they can now glory in't, take a pride in't, and think themſelves pretty well at eaſe, and there minds and are ſomewhat quiet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beguiled with ſin.</p>
               <p>But my friend, when thou haſt loſt this life, and doſt begin to lift up thine eyes in hell, and ſeeſt what thy ſins have brought thee to; and not onely ſo, but that thou by thy filthy ſins didſt cauſe others, (devil-like) to fall into the ſame condemnation with thee: And that one of the reaſons of their damnation was this, that thou didſt lead them to the commiſſion of thoſe wicked practices of this world, and the luſts thereof. Oh! that ſome body would ſtop them from coming, leſt they alſo come into this place of torment, and be damned as I am; how will it torment me? For the reaſon (as I ſaid before) why ſome mens condemnations are more intollerable then others, is ſometimes, becauſe they have not onely damned themſelves by
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170678:86"/> their ſins, but their ungodly carriages have been ſtumbling-blocks to others; cauſing them alſo to ſtumble and fall at that for which thou thy ſelf art damned. <hi>Balaam</hi> could not be contented to be damned himſelf, but alſo he muſt by his wickedneſs cauſe others to ſtumble and fall.<note place="margin">Rev. 2.14.</note> The Scribes and Phariſees could not be converted to keep out of heaven themſelves, but they muſt labour to keep out others too.</p>
               <p>The deceived cannot be content to be deceived himſelf, but he muſt labour to deceive others alſo. The drunkard cannot be contented to go to hell for his own ſins, but he muſt labour to cauſe others to fall into the ſame furnace with him. O friends! look to your ſelves, for here will be damnation upon dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, damned for thy own ſins, and damned for thy being a partaker with others in their ſins; and damned for being guilty of the damnation of others. O how will the drunkard cry for leading their neighbours into drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs? How will the covetous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon howle for ſetting his neighbour, his friend, his brother, his children and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations ſo wicked an example; by which
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170678:86"/> he hath not onely wronged his own ſoul, but alſo the ſouls of others. The liar by lying, learned others to lie; the ſwearer learned others to ſwear, the whoremonger learns others to whore. Now all theſe, with others of the like ſort, will be guilty, not onely of their own damnation, but alſo of the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others. I tell you, that ſome men have been ſo much the authors of the damnation of others, that I am ready to think that the damnation of them will trouble them as much as their own damnation. Some men (it is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) at the day of judgement will be found to be the author of deſtroying whole nations. How many ſouls do you think <hi>Balaam</hi> with his deceit will have to anſwer for? How many, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet?</hi> How many, the Phariſees, that hired the ſouldiers to ſay the Diſciples ſtole away Jeſus, and by that means ſtumbled their brethren to this day; and was one means of hindering them from believing the things of God and Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo the cauſe of the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their brethren to this very day.</p>

What ſayeſt thou, Landlord, will it not cut thy ſoul, when thou ſhalt ſee that thou couldeſt not be content to miſs of heaven thy ſelf, but thou muſt labour to hinder others alſo?

               <p>From whence obſerve; That it is not an eaſie matter to perſwade them who are in their ſins alive in this world, that they muſt and ſhall be damned if they turne not, and be converted to God. Let him teſtifie to them, let him ſpeak confidently, though they frown upon
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170678:89"/> him, or diſlike his way of ſpeaking to them. And how is this truth verified and cleared by the carriages of almoſt all men now in the world, toward them that do preach the Goſpel; and ſhew their own miſerable ſtate plainly to them if they cloſe not with it. If a man do but indeed labour to convince ſinners of their ſins, and loſt condition by nature, though they muſt be damned if they live and die in that condition; Oh how angry are they at it. Look how he judges, ſay they; hark how he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns us; he tells us we muſt be damned if we live and die in this ſtate; we are offended at him, we cannot abide to hear him, or any ſuch as he; we will believe none of them all, but go on in the way we are a going.</p>
               <p>I ſay, tell the drunkard he muſt be damned if he leave not his drunkenneſs, the ſwearer, liar, cheater, thief, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, railers, or any ungodly perſons, they muſt and ſhall lie in hell for it, if they die in this condition, they will not believe you, nor credit you. Again, tell others that there are many in hell that have lived and died in their conditions, and ſo are they like to be if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert

Again, there are others that are more civil and ſober men, who, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we know that their civility will not ſave them) if we do but tell them plainly of the emptineſs, and unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of that, as to the ſaving of their ſouls, and that God will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them, nor love them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe things, and that if they intend to be ſaved, they muſt be better provided than with ſuch a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as this; they will either fling away and come to hear no more, or elſe if they do come, they will bring ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice with them in their hearts, <hi>that the word preached ſhall not profit them, it being mixed, not with faith but with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice in them that hear it.</hi> Nay, they will ſome of them be ſo full of anger, that they will break out and call even thoſe that ſpeak the truth <hi>Heretiques;</hi> and ſay they would deceive them. And why ſo? Becauſe they tell them, that if they live in their ſins that will damne them, yet if the turne and live a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life, according to the holy and juſt and good law of God, that will not ſave them. Yea, becauſe we tell them
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170678:90"/> plainly, that unleſs they leave their ſins and righteouſneſs too and cloſe in with a naked Jeſus Chriſt, his blood and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and what he hath done, and is now doing for ſinners, they cannot be ſaved. And unleſs they do eat the fleſh of the Sonne of man and drink his blood, they have no life abiding in them: they gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel preſently, and are offended at it (as the Jews were with Chriſt for ſpeaking of the ſame thing to them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.53, 60.) and fling away themſelves, the ſouls and all, by quarrelling againſt the doctrine of the Sonne of God, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they do, though they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they do; and therefore he that is a Preacher of the word, had need, not onely tell them, <hi>but teſtifie to them</hi> again, and again, that their ſins, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in them, will damne them, and damne them again. And tell them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, their living honeſtly according to the law, their paying every one their own, their living quietly with their neighbours, their giving to the poor, their notion of the Goſpel, and ſaying they do believe in Chriſt, will do them no good at the general day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are offended alſo. Ha friends!
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170678:91"/> how many of you are there at this very day, that have been told once and again, of your loſt undone condition, becauſe you want the right, reall, and ſaving work of God upon our ſouls. I ſay, hath not this been told you, yea, teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you from time to time, that your ſtate is miſerable, that yet you are never the better, but do ſtill ſtand where you did; ſome in an openly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly life, and ſome drowned in a ſelf-conceited holineſs of Chriſtianity. Therefore for Gods ſake if you love your ſouls, conſider, and beg of God for Jeſus Chriſts ſake, that he would work ſuch a work of grace in your hearts, and give you ſuch a faith in his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, that you may not onely have reſt here, as you think, not onely think your ſtate ſafe while you live here; but that you may be ſafe indeed, not onely here, but alſo when you are gone; leſt you do cry in the anguiſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity of your ſouls, O ſend one to my companions that have been beguiled by Satan, as I have been; and ſo by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, come into this place of torment, as I have done.</p>
               <p>Again, one thing more is to be obſerved

That though ſome ſouls for ſin do fall into the bottomleſs pit of hell before their fellows, becauſe they depart this world before them; yet the other abiding in the ſame courſe, are as ſure to go to the ſame place, as if they were there already. How ſo? Becauſe, they are all condemned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they have all fallen under the ſame law, and have all offended the ſame ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and muſt for certain, if they die in that condition, drink as deep, if not deeper, of the ſame deſtruction.

Juſt as if there were a company of priſoners at the bar, and all condemned to die; what, becauſe they are not all executed in one day, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall they not be executed at all? Yes, the ſame law that executed its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity upon the parties now deceaſed, will for certain be executed on them that are alive in its appointed time: Even ſo it is here, we are all condemned by nature, if we cloſe not in with the grace of God by Jeſus Chriſt, we muſt and ſhall be deſtroyed with the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; <hi>and therefore, ſend him (ſaith he)</hi> leſt.

               <p>That <hi>there is a poſſibility of obtaining mercy, if now, I ſay, now in this day of grace we turn from our ſins to Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> yea, it is more then poſſible. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for thy incouragement, do thou know for certain, that if thou ſhalt in this thy day accept of mercy upon Gods own terms, and cloſe with him effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, God hath promiſed, yea made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny promiſes, that thy ſoul ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted ſafe to glory, and ſhall for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain eſcape all the evils that I have told thee of; I, and many more then I can imagine. Do but ſearch the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and ſee how full of conſolation they are to a poor ſoul that is minded to cloſe in with Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>He that commeth to me (ſaith Chriſt) I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Though he be an old ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>I will in no wiſe caſt him out.</hi> Mark, <hi>in no wiſe,</hi> though he be a great ſinner, <hi>I will in no wiſe caſt him out,</hi> if he come to me. Though he have ſlighted me never ſo many times, and not regarded the welfare of his own ſoul, yet let him now come to me, and notwithſtanding this, <hi>I will in no wiſe caſt him out,</hi> nor throw away his ſoul, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. Again, ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>Now</hi> (Mark now) <hi>is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170678:93"/> the accepted time, now is the day of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now here is mercy good ſtore, now Gods heart is open to ſinners: now he will make you welcome; now he will receive any body if they do but come to Chriſt. He that comes to me (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> And why? <hi>Becauſe now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſalvation.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2, 3. As if the Apoſtle had ſaid, If you will have mercy, have it now, receive it now, cloſe in with it now.</p>
               <p>God hath a certain day to hold out his grace to ſinners; Now is the time, now is the day. 'Tis true, there is a day of damnation, but this is a day of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 'Tis true, there is a day coming wherein ſinners, muſt cry to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to fall on them, to the hills to cover them from the wrath of God; but now, now, is the day in which he doth hold out his grace. There is a day a coming in which you will not be admitted to have the priviledge of one drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to cool your tongue; if now, I ſay, if now you ſlight his grace and goodneſs which he holds out to you. Ah friends, conſider there is now hopes of mercy, but then there will not; now Chriſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170678:93"/> holds forth mercy unto you, but then he will not. (<hi>Mat.</hi> 7.23.) Now there are his Servants that do beſeech you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his grace, but if thou loſe the opportunity that is put into thine hand, thou thy ſelf mayeſt beſeech hereafter, and no mercy be given thee. <hi>And he cryed and ſaid, Father Abraham have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on me, and ſend Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue.</hi> And there was none given. Therefore, let it never be ſaid of thee as it will be ſaid of ſome; <hi>Why is there a price put into the hand of a fool, ſeeing he hath no heart to it:</hi> Seeing he hath no heart to make a good uſe of it, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 17.16.) conſider therefore with thy ſelf, and ſay, It is better going to heaven then hell; it is better to be ſaved then damned; it is better to be with Saints, then with damned ſouls; and to go to God, is better then to go to the devil.</p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>ſeek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near. Iſa.</hi> 55.6. Leſt in thy trouble he leave thee to thy ſelf, and ſay unto thee plainly, <hi>Where I am, thither ye cannot come.</hi> Joh. 8.21.</p>
               <p>O if they that are in hell might but
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170678:94"/> now again have one ſuch invitation as this, how would they leap for joy. I have thought ſometimes, ſhould God ſend but one of his miniſters to the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in hell and give him commiſſion to preach the free love of God in Chriſt extended to them, and held out to them, if now while it is profered to them they will accept of his kindneſs; O how welcome would they make this news, and cloſe in with it on any termes.</p>
               <p>Certainly they would ſay, we will accept of grace on any termes in the world, and thank you too, though it coſt life and limbs to boot, we will ſpare no coſt, nor charge, if mercy may be had. But poor ſouls, while they live here they will not part from ſin, with hell-bred, deviliſh ſin: No, they will rather loſe their ſouls then loſe their filthy ſins. But friend, thou wilt change thy note ere it be long, and cry <hi>O ſimple wretch that I am, that I ſhould damne my ſoul by ſin.</hi> 'Tis true, I have had the Goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me and have been invited in: I have been preached to, and have been warned of this; but <hi>how have I hated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and mine heart deſpiſed reproof: I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170678:94"/> nor inclined mine eare to them that inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted me.</hi> Prov. 5.10, 11. O therefore, I ſay, poor ſoul, is there hope, then lay thine hand upon thy mouth and kiſs the duſt, and cloſe in with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and make much of his glorious mercy, and invite alſo thy companions to cloſe in with the ſame Lord Jeſus Chriſt, leſt one of you do go to hell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, and expect with grief of heart, your companions to come after: And in the mean time with anguiſh of ſpirit do ſigh and ſay,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O ſend him to my companions, and let him teſtifie to them, leſt they alſo come into this place of torment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again I might obſerve from theſe words, that though men in their life time are ſo proud and ſtout, that they will not hear nor regard the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and their exhortations, I ſay, in their life time: yet the time is coming, that they would be glad, that the very meaneſt of all the ſervants of God, ſhould not onely adminiſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to them, but alſo, (when once they are departed this life) that even thoſe whom once they ſlighted ſhould go and teſtifie the certainty of eternal damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>IN the verſes foregoing, you ſee there is a diſcovery of the lamentable ſtate of the poor ſoul that dies out of Chriſt, and the ſpecial favour of God. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo how little the glorious God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven doth regard and take notice of their moſt miſerable condition, that he will not ſo much as afford them one drop of cold water; that is, the leaſt eaſe or comfort. Now in this verſe, the Lord doth magnifie the word which was ſpoken to the people by the Prophets and Apoſtles, where he ſaith, <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets, let them here them.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, thou askeſt me that I ſhould ſend <hi>Lazarus</hi> back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the world, to preach to them that live there, that they might eſcape that doleful place that thou art in: what
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170678:95"/> needs that? have they not <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, have they not had my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and ſervants ſent unto them, and coming as from me? I ſent <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Noah, Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Samuel.</hi> I ſent <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hoſea,</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Peter, Paul, John, Matthew, James, Jude,</hi> with the reſt; <hi>Let them hear them.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay again, what they have ſpoken by divine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I will own, whether it be for the damnation of thoſe that reject, or the ſaving of them that receive their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: And therefore, what need have they that one ſhould be ſent unto them in another way? Seeing they have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets <hi>let them hear them;</hi> let them receive their word, cloſe in with the doctrine declared by them; <hi>let them hear them.</hi> I ſhall not at this time ſpeak any thing to that word <hi>(Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham)</hi> having touched upon it already; but ſhall tell you what is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by theſe words, <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets, let them hear them.</hi> The things that I ſhall obſerve from hence are theſe. 1. That the Scriptures ſpoken by the holy men of God, are a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170678:96"/> ſufficient rule to inſtruct to ſalvation, them that do aſſuredly believe and cloſe in with what they hold forth. <hi>They have Moſes and the prophets, let them hear them.</hi> That is, if they would eſcape, that doleful place, and be ſaved indeed from the intollerable pains of hell fire, as they deſire, they have that which is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to counſel them, for their going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide from that. <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> let them be inſtructed by them, be admoniſhed by them, <hi>let them hear them;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.17.</note> for all Scripture is given by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God; and is profitable for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in righteouſneſs, why, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed to every good work.</p>
               <p>Do but mark the words. <hi>All Scripture is profitable,</hi> Mark <hi>All,</hi> take it where you will, and in what place you will; <hi>profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> for what? <hi>That the man of God,</hi> or he that is bound for heaven, and would inſtruct others in their progreſs thither.</p>
               <p>It is profitable to inſtruct him, in caſe he be ignorant; to reprove him, in caſe he tranſgreſs; to correct him, if he hath need of it; to confirme him, if he be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering. It is profitable for doctrine, &amp; all
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170678:96"/> this in a very righteous way, that the poor ſoul may not onely be helped, but throughly furniſhed, not onely to ſome, but to all good works.

               <p>Reader, here might I ſpend many ſheets of paper, yea, I might upon this ſubject write a very great book, but I ſhall now forbear, deſiring thee to be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in the Scriptures, <hi>for they are they that will teſtifie of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 5.39.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170678:101"/> plainly, I do believe that the devil knows this full well, which makes him labour to beget in the hearts of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and followers light thoughts of them; and doth perſwade them that even a motion from their own beguiled conſcience, or from his own wicked Spirit, is to be obſerved, and obeyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: when the very Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, though he heard a voice from the excellent glory ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, &amp;c.</hi> Yet writing to the Churches, and telling them he heard ſuch a voice he commends the writings of the Prophets before it, ſaying, <hi>We have alſo a more ſure word of the Prophets, unto which ye do well to take heed, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Pet. 1, 17, 18, 19. Now if thou doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt whether that place be meant the Scriptures, the words of the Prophets, or no, read but the next verſe, where he addeth for a certain confirmation thereof theſe words. <hi>Knowing this firſt, that there is no prophecy of the Scriptures.</hi> Mark, it is the prophecy of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. <hi>There is no prophecy of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of any private interpretation: for prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were

               </p>
               <p>And therefore, O what a ſad thing is it with thoſe that go about to diſown the Scriptures. I tell you, however you may ſlight them now, yet when they come into hell, and in bitterneſs of ſoul cry out, Oh that one might go to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn my companions of their folly, <hi>leſt they come into this place of torment.</hi> God doth and will anſwer them with theſe words, <hi>they have Moſes and the Prophets, let them hear them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, it is very obſervable, who they are, that are ſo toſſed to and fro with the ſeveral winds of doctrine, that have been broached in theſe dayes. They are ſuch, for the moſt part, as have had a light eſteem of the Scriptures: for the ground of errour (as Chriſt ſaith) is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know not them, <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.24. And indeed it is juſt with God to give them over to follow their own dark blinded conſciences, to be led into errours, that they might be damned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell, who did not believe that the things contained in the Scripture were the truth, that they might be ſaved and go to heaven.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170678:103"/> thou ſpeakeſt of the Scriptures of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and the Prophets, and ſayeſt, let them hear them,</hi> but theſe things are not ſo vvell as I could vviſh, I had rather thou wouldſt ſend one from the dead. In theſe vvords therefore, <hi>Nay, Father Abraham,</hi> there is a repulſe given. Nay, let it not be ſo. Nay I do not like of that anſvver; Hear <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets? nay. The ſame expreſſion is uſed by Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.2, 3. <hi>Think you that they upon whom the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Siloe fell, were ſinners above others? I tell you nay, for except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> So here, <hi>Nay, Father Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. By this vvord nay, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſignified a rejecting the firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver. Novv obſerve, I pray you, the reaſon vvhy he ſayes nay, is, becauſe God doth put over all thoſe that vvill be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to obſerve and receive the truth contained in Scripture, and believe that. To have high eſteem of them, and to love and ſearch them, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Search the Scriptures,—for they are they which teſtifie of me. Joh.</hi> 5.39. But the damned ſay, Nay; as if he had ſaid, It is true, the Scriptures are truth, and every curſe contained in, and held forth by them, ſhall be fulfilled, and have its time
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170678:104"/> to be executed on them vvho live and die in unbelief; as novv I feel by vvoful experience, for I ſvvim novv in the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and vvrath vvhich once they told me I ſhould partake of. But this is the thing to be ſhort, my brethren are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, and do not regard the word of God, I know it by my ſelf, for when I was in the world it was ſo with me. 'Tis true, many a good Sermon did I hear, many a time was I admoniſhed, deſired, intreated, beſeeched, threatned, forewarned of what I now ſuffer: But alas, I was ignorant, ſelf-conceited, ſurly, obſtinate and rebellious. 'Tis true, many a time the preacher told me, hell would be my portion, the devill would wreck his malice on me, God would pour on me his ſore diſpleaſure, but he had as good have preached to the ſtock, to the poſt, to the ſtones I trod on. 'Tis true, his words rang in mine ears, but I kept them from my heart. I remember he alledged many a Scripture, but thoſe I valued not; the Scriptures thought I, what are they? a dead let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a little ink and paper, of three or four ſhillings price. Alas, what is the Scripture, give me a Ballad, a News<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170678:104"/> 
                  <hi>George</hi> on horſeback, or <hi>Bevis</hi> of <hi>Southhampton,</hi> give me ſome book that teaches curious arts, that tells of old fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; but for the holy Scriptures I cared not. And as it was with me then, ſo it is with my brethren now; we were all of one ſpirit, loved all the ſame ſins, ſlighted all the ſame counſels, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, incouragements, and threatnings of the Scriptures; and they are ſtill as I left them, ſtill in unbelief, ſtill provoking God, and rejecting good counſel, ſo hardned in their wayes, ſo bent to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſin, that let the Scriptures be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them daily, let the meſſengers of Chriſt preach till their hearts ake, till they fall down dead with preaching, they will rather trampleit under foot, and ſwine like, rent them, than cloſe in with thoſe gentle and bleſſed profers of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Thus therefore theſe words, (<hi>Nay Father Abraham, but if one ſhould riſe from the dead they would repent,</hi> are to be underſtood. That the world of ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men will not regard the Scriptures ſeriouſly. <hi>Though they have Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> (the Scriptures) they will not repent or heartily cloſe in with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170678:105"/> Chriſt, though the Scriptures do wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt them. If therefore there be any good done to them, they muſt have it another way. I think, ſaith he, it would work much on them, <hi>if one ſhould riſe from the dead.</hi> And this truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is ſo evident, that ungodly ones have a light eſteem of the Scriptures, that it needs not many ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove it, being ſo evidently manifeſted by their every dayes pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, both in words and actions, almoſt in all things they ſay and do.

               <p>But alas we need not be ſo earneſt in quoting the Scriptures ſo plentifully, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any one or two places are enough. And beſides, the converſation of almoſt all men doth bear witneſs to the ſame, both religious, and profane perſons: in that they daily neglect, reject, and turn their backs upon the plain teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Scriptures.</p>

               <p>As 1.

               <p>But for all this, how thick, and by heaps, do theſe wretches walk up and down our ſtreets? Do but go into the Alehouſes &amp; you ſhall ſee almoſt every room beſprinkled with them, ſo foming out their own ſhame, that it is enough to make the heart of a Saint to tremble, in ſo much that they would not be bound to have ſociety with them any long while for all the world. For as the wayes of the godly are not liked of by the wicked, even <hi>ſo the wayes of the wicked are an abomination to the juſt,</hi> Prov. 29.27. Pſal. 120.5, 6.</p>
               <p>As now to particularize ſome things.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170678:107"/> The Scriptures ſay, <hi>Curſed is the man that truſteth in man, that maketh fleſh his arm, and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord.</hi> Jer. 17, 5.</p>
               <p>And yet how many poor ſouls are there in the world, that ſtand in ſo much aw, and dread of man, and do ſo highly eſteem their favour, that they will rather venture their ſouls in the hands of the devil, with their favour, then they will fly to Jeſus Chriſt for the ſalvation of their ſoul, if they muſt loſe their favour, and have their frownes and diſpleaſure for the ſame. Nay, though they be convinced in their ſouls that the way is the way of God; yet how do they labour to ſtiſle convictions, and turn their ears away from the truth, and all becauſe they will not loſe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of an oppoſite neighbour. Oh! I dare not for my Maſter, my Brother, my Landlord, I ſhall loſe his favour, his houſe of work, and ſo decay my calling. O ſaith another, I would willingly go in this way, but for my Father, he chides and tells me, he will not ſtand my friend when I come to wants; I ſhall never enjoy a penyworth of his goods, he will diſinherit me. And I dare not,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170678:107"/> ſaith another, for my Husband, for he will be a railing, and tells me, he will turn me out of doors, he will beat me, and cut off my legs. But I tell you, if any of theſe, or any other things be ſo prevalent with thee now, as to keep thee from ſeeking after Chriſt in his wayes; they will alſo be ſo prevalent with God againſt thee, as to make him caſt off thy ſoul, becauſe thou didſt rather truſt man then God; and delight in the imbracings of man, rather than in the favour of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>He that being often reproved heardneth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed and that without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,</hi> Prov. 29.1.

               <p>For commonly the Lord hath this

               <p>But men for the moſt part are ſo far off from believing the certainty of this, that the will ſcarce loſe the earning of a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to hear the word of God, the Goſpel of ſalvation. Nay, they will neither go themſelves nor ſuffer others to go, (if they can help it) without threatning to do them a miſchief, if it lie in their way: Nay further, many are ſo far from parting from any worldly gain, for Chriſts ſake and the Goſpels, that they are ſtill ſtriving, by hook and by crook, as we ſay, by ſwearing, lying, couſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

Now if any do not run with them to the ſame exceſs of riot, but rather for all their threats, will be ſo bold, and careleſs (as they call it) as to follow the wayes of God; if they can do no more, yet they will whet their tongues like a ſword to wound them, and do them the greateſt miſchief they can, both in ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them to neighbours, to wives, to husbands, to landlords and raiſing falſe reports of them.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170678:116"/> that you will find that you have ſinned againſt God, and beguiled your hearers, when God ſhall in the judgement-day lay the cauſe of the damnation of many thouſands of ſouls to your charge, and ſay, <hi>He will require their blood at your hands. Ezek.</hi> 33.6.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another reaſon why the carnal unbelieving world do ſo ſlight the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and word of God, is, becauſe the judgement ſpoken of in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is not preſently executed on the tranſgreſſors. <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an evil act is not ſpeedily executed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the hearts of the ſons of men are wholly ſet in them to do evil.

Now

                  <p n="5">5. Another reaſon why the blind world do ſlight the authority of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, is, becauſe they give ear to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who through his ſubtilty caſteth falſe evaſions, and corrupt interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on them, rendring them not ſo point blank the minde of God, and a rule for direction to poor ſouls, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them, that they muſt give ear and way to ſomething elſe beſides, and beyond that: or elſe he labours to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it vile and contemptible, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them that it is a dead letter, when indeed they know not what they ſay nor whereof they affirme. For the Scripture is not ſo dead, but that the knowledge of it is able to make any man wiſe unto ſalvation through faith and love which is in Chriſt Jeſus, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. And is profitable for inſtruction, reproof, and correction in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that the man of God may be throughly furniſhed to all good works, <hi>ver.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>And where it is ſaid the letter killeth, he meaneth the law, as it is the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170678:117"/> of damnation, or a covenant of works, and ſo indeed it doth kill, and muſt do ſo, becauſe it is juſt: foraſmuch as the party that is under the ſame, is not able to yield to it a compleat and continual obedience. But otherwiſe I will call <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> to witneſs, that the Scriptures are of a very glorious concernment, in as much as in them is held forth to us the way of life; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, in that they do adminiſter good ground of hope to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>For whatſoever things were written a foretime</hi> (Mark, whatſoever) <hi>were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scripture m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ght have hope.</hi> And again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25, 26. <hi>Now to him that is of power to stabliſh you according to my Goſpel, and the preaching of Jeſus Chriſt according to the revelation of the miſtery which was kept hid ſince the world began, but now is made manifeſt, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlaſting God, made known to all nations for the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faith.</hi> And therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they be that ſlight the Scriptures, they ſlight that which is no leſs then the word of God; and they who ſlight
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170678:117"/> that, ſlight him that ſpake it; and they that do ſo, let them look to themſelves, for God will be revenged on ſuch. Much more might be ſaid to this thing, but I would not be tedious.</p>
                  <p>A word or two more, and ſo I have done with this. Conſider the dangers of ſlighting the words of the Prophets or Apoſtles, whether they be, correction, reproof, admonition, forewarning, or the bleſſed invitations and promiſes contained in them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such ſouls do provoke God to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and to execute his vengeance on them. <hi>They refuſed to hearken, they pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away their ſhoulder, they ſtopped their ears leſt they ſhould hear the law, and they made their hearts adament ſtone, that they might not hear the law, and the words that were ſpoken to them by his ſpirit in the former prophets: Therefore came a great wrath upon them.</hi> Zach. 7.11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God will not regard in their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. <hi>Becauſe I called and ye refuſed, I ſtretched out my hand &amp; no man regarded, but ſet at nought all my counſels, and would none of my reproof: I alſo will laugh at your calamities, and mock when your fear cometh. When their fear cometh as
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170678:118"/> deſolation, and their deſtruction, like a whirlewind. Then ſhall they call, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me,</hi> Proverbs, 1.25, 26, 27.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God doth commonly give up ſuch men to deluſions to believe lies. <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved, therefore God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lie. That they all might be damned,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In a word, they that do continue to reject and ſlight the word of God, they are ſuch, for the moſt part, as are ordained to be damned. Old <hi>Eli</hi> his ſons not hearkenning to the voice of their father reproving them for their ſins, but diſobeying his voice, it is ſaid, <hi>It was becauſe the Lord would ſlay them.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.15. Again, ſee in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.15, 16. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maziah</hi> having ſinned againſt the Lord, he ſends to him a prophet to reprove him: But <hi>Amaziah</hi> ſayes, <hi>Forbear, wherefore ſhouldſt thou be ſmitten?</hi> (he did not hearken to the word of God) <hi>Then the Prophet forbare, ſaying, I know that God hath determined to deſtroy thee, becauſe thou haſt not hearkened to my

                  <p>Other things might have been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from this verſe, which at this time I ſhall paſs by; partly becauſe the ſum of them hath been touched already, and may be more clearly hinted at in the following verſe, and therefore I ſhall ſpeak a few words to the next verſe, and to draw towards a concluſion.</p>

                     </bibl> And he ſaid unto him, If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they be perſwaded, though one riſe from the dead.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>ANd he ſaid] That is, and God made anſwer to the words ſpoken in the verſe before, <hi>And he ſaid unto him, If they hear not Moſes.</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, <hi>Moſes</hi> was a man of great renown, A man of worthy note, A man that talked with God face to face, as a man ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his friend; The words that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake were ſuch as I commanded him to ſpeak. Let who will queſtion them, I will own them, credit them,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170678:119"/> bleſs them that cloſe in with them, and curſe thoſe that reject them.</p>
               <p>I my ſelf ſent the prophets they did not run of their own heads: I gave them commiſſion: I thruſt them out, and told them what they ſhould ſay. In a word, they have told the world what my mind is to do both to ſinners and to ſaints. <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets let them hear them.</hi> Therefore he that ſhall reject and turn his back either upon the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, counſels, admonitions, invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, promiſes, or whatſoever elſe I have commanded them to ſpeak, as to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and life, and to directions therein, ſhall be ſure to have a ſhare in the many curſes, that they have ſpoken, and the deſtruction that is pronounced by them.</p>
               <p>Again <hi>if they hear not Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, thou wouldeſt have me ſend one from the dead unto them, what needs that? They have my mind already, I have declared unto them what I intend to ſtand to, both for ſaving them that believe, and damning them that do not. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which I have ſaid I will make good, whether they hear, or forbear. And as for this deſire of yours, you had as
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170678:119"/> good deſire me to make a new Bible, and ſo to revoke my firſt ſayings by the mouth of my prophets. But I am God, and not man, and my word is immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unchangeable, and ſhall ſtand as faſt as my decrees can make it; <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but one jot or tittle of my word ſhall not paſs.</hi> If thou hadſt ten thouſand brethren, and every one in danger of loſing his ſoul, if they did not cloſe in with what is contained and recorded in the Scriptures of truth, they muſt even every one of them periſh and be for ever damned in hell: for the Scriptures cannot be broken. I did not ſend them ſo unadviſedly to recall it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by another conſideration. No, <hi>for I ſpeak it righteouſneſs and judgement, Iſa.</hi> 63.1, 2, 3. and in much wiſdom and counſel. It being therefore gone out of my mouth in this manner, <hi>it ſhall not return in vain until it hath accompliſhed the thing whereto I have ſent it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But again, thou ſuppoſeſt that miracles and wonders will work more on them, which makes thee ſay, ſend one from the dead. But herein thou art miſtaken, for I have proved them with that once and again, by more then one, or two, or three
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170678:120"/> of my ſervants. How many miracles did my ſervant <hi>Moſes</hi> work by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment from me in the land of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> at the red ſea, and in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet they of that generation were never the ſooner converted for that, but notwithſtanding rebelled &amp; luſted, and in their hearts turned back into <hi>Egypt, Acts</hi> 7. How many miracles did <hi>Samuel, David, Elias, Eliſha, Daniel,</hi> and the Prophets, together with my Sonne, who raiſed the dead, caſt out devils, made them to ſee that were borne blind, gave and reſtored limbs, yet for all this (as I ſaid before) they hated him, they cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him. I raiſed him again from the dead, and he appeared to his diſciples who were called, and choſen, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and he gave them commandment and commiſſion to go and teſtifie the truth of this to the world: and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame he inabled them to ſpeak with divers tongues, and to work mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles moſt plentifully, yet there was great perſecution raiſed againſt them, inſomuch that but a few of them died in their beds. And therefore, though thou thinkeſt that a miracle will do ſo much with the world, yet I ſay, No. <hi>For if
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170678:120"/> they will not believe Moſes and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, neither will they be perſwaded though one ſhould riſe from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From theſe words therefore take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this truth, namely that thoſe who reject, and believe not <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, are a very hard-hearted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that will not be perſwaded though one riſe from the dead.</p>
               <p>Again, they that regard not the holy Scriptures to turn to God, finding them to teſtifie of his goodneſs and mercie, there is but little hopes of their ſalvation; <hi>for they will not,</hi> Mark, <hi>They will not be perſwaded though one ſhould riſe from the dead.</hi> This truth is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. If you read <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. where the Lord is ſpeaking of himſelf, that he is the very Chriſt: he brings in four or five witneſſes to back what he ſaid. Firſt, <hi>John Baptist.</hi> 2 The works that his Father gave him to do. 3. His Father ſpeaking from heaven. 4. The teſtimony of the Scriptures; when all this was done, ſeeing yet they would not believe, he layes the fault upon one of theſe two things. 1. Their regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an eſteem among men. 2. Their not believing of the Prophets writings, even
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170678:121"/> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> and the reſt. <hi>For had ye believed Moſes</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>ye would have believed me;</hi> why? <hi>For he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his writings, how can ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my words.</hi> Now I ſay, he that ſhall ſlight the Scriptures, and the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the prophets in them concerning Jeſus Chriſt, muſt needs be in great danger of loſing his ſoul if he abide in this condition; becauſe he that ſlights the teſtimony, doth alſo ſlight the thing that is teſtified of, let him ſay what he will, and ſay the contrary never ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. For as Jeſus Chriſt hath here laid down the reaſon of mens not receiving him, ſo the Apoſtle in another place layes down the reaſon again with an high and mighty aggravation. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. ſaying, <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witneſs in himſelf: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; becauſe he believeth not the Record.</hi> Mark, <hi>the Record that God gave of his Son.</hi> The record, you will ſay, what is that? Even the teſtimony that God gave of him by the mouth of all the holy Prophets ſince the world began, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.20. That is, God ſending his holy Spirit into the hearts of his ſervants the Prophets and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170678:121"/> Apoſtles, he by his Spirit in them did bear witneſs, or record, to the truth of ſalvation by his Son Jeſus, both before, and after his comming. And thus is that place alſo to be underſtood which ſaith, <hi>There are three that bear record in earth, the Spirit and the Water, and the Blood.</hi> That is, the Spirit in the Apoſtles which preached him to the world, as is clear if you read ſeriouſly, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.8. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of Jeſus Chriſt, and obedience to God through him, ſaith thus, <hi>Now he that deſpiſeth, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not us,</hi> No? who then? <hi>Why God:</hi> But it is you that ſpeak. True, but it is by and through the Spirit. <hi>He therefore that deſpiſeth, deſpiſeth not man, but God, who alſo hath given us of his holy Spirit.</hi> This is therefore a mighty confirmation of this truth, that he that ſlights the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord or teſtimony that God by his ſpirit in his Prophets and Apoſtles hath teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied unto us, ſlights the teſtimony of the ſpirit who moved them to ſpeak theſe things: and if ſo, then I would fain know, how any man can be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt that ſlights the teſtimony concerning Chriſt, yea, the teſtimony of his own ſpirit concerning his own ſelf.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170678:122"/>
'Tis true, men may pretend to have the teſtimony of the Spirit, and from that conceit ſet a low eſteem on the holy Scriptures: But that ſpirit that dwelleth in them and teacheth them ſo to do, it is no better then the ſpirit of Satan, though it calls it ſelf by the name of the ſpirit of Chriſt. <hi>To the law therefore and to the teſtimony,</hi> Try them by that: <hi>If they ſpeak not according to this word, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no light in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> when he ſpeaks of the glorious voice that he had from the excellent Majeſty, ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear him,</hi> ſaith thus to them whom he wrote unto; <hi>You have alſo a more ſure word of prophecy</hi> (or of the prophets, for ſo you may read it) <hi>unto which you do well that you take heed.</hi> That is, though we tell you that we had his excellent teſtimony from his own mouth, evidently, yet you have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: we tell you this, and you need not doubt of the truth of it, but if you ſhould, yet you may not, muſt not, ought not, to queſtion them, Search therefore unto them until the day dawn, and the day ſtar ariſe in your hearts. That is, until by the ſame ſpirit that gave
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170678:122"/> forth the Scripture, you find the truth confirmed to your ſouls which you have recorded in the Scriptures. That this word of prophecy, or of the prophets, is the Scriptures, read on. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>knowing this firſt that no prophecy of the Scriptures, is of any private interpretation,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Pet. 1.18, 19, 20. But you will ſay, What needs all this ado, and why is all this time and pains ſpent in ſpeaking to this that is ſurely believed already? This is a thing received by all, that they believe the Scriptures to be the word of God, that ſure word of prophecy, and therefore you need not ſpend your time in proving theſe things and the truth of them ſeeing we grant and confeſs the truth of it before you begin to ſpeak your judgement of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The truths of God cannot be borne witneſs unto too often, you may as well ſay, You need not preach Jeſus Chriſt ſo much, ſeeing he hath been and is received for the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though many may ſuppoſe that they do believe the Scriptures, yet if they were but well examined you would find them either by word of mouth, or
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170678:123"/> elſe by converſation, to deny, reject, and ſlight the holy Scriptures. 'Tis true, there is a notional, and hiſtoricall aſſent in the head, I ſay, <hi>In the head</hi> of many, or moſt, to the truth contained in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: but try them, I ſay, and you ſhall find but a little, if any, of the faith of the operation of God, in the hearts of poor men to believe the Scriptures and things contained in them. 'Tis true, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yea moſt men believe the Scriptures as they believe a fable, a ſtory, a tale, of which there is no certainty; but alas! there are but few do intend, and in truth believe the Scriptures to be the very word of God.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, this ſeems ſtrange to me. <hi>Anſw.</hi> And it ſeems as true to me, and I doubt not but to make it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and plainly to appear, that there are but few, yea, very few, that do effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually (for that I aim at) believe the Scriptures, and the truths contained in, and ſpoken of by them. But to make this appear, and that to purpoſe (if God will) I ſhall lay you down the ſeveral operations that the Scriptures have on them who do effectually believe the things contained in them.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:170678:123"/>1. He that doth effectually believe the Scriptures, hath in the firſt place been killed, I ſay killed by the authoirty of the holy Scriptures; ſtruck ſtark dead in a ſpiritual ſenſe by the holy Scripture, being ſet home by that ſpirit which gave them forth upon the ſoul. <hi>The letter killeth;</hi> the letter ſtrikes men dead, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. and this <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſed and found before he could ſay, <hi>I believe all that the prophets have ſpoken.</hi> Where he ſaith, <hi>I was alive without the Law once;</hi> That is, in my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate, before the Law was ſet on my heart with power: <hi>But when the commandement came, ſinne revived and I died,</hi> Rom. 7.9. <hi>and that law that was ordained to life I found to be unto death: For ſin taking occaſion by the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deceived me, and thereby ſtew me.</hi> v. 10. Now that which is called the Letter in <hi>Cor.</hi> is called the Law in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. which by its power and operation, as it is wielded by the Spirit of God, doth in the firſt place kill and ſlay all thoſe that are enabled to believe the Scriptures. I kill ſaith God; That is, with my law. I pierce, I wound, I prick men into the very heart by ſhewing them their ſins againſt
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170678:124"/> my law, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36, 37. And he that is ignorant of this, is alſo ignorant of, and doth not really and effectually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scripture.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, how doth the law kill and ſtrike dead the poor creature? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt the letter or law, do kill thus. It is ſet home upon the ſoul, and diſcovers to the ſoul its tranſgreſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law; and ſhews the ſoul alſo that it cannot compleatly ſatisfie the juſtice of God for the breach of his law, therefore it is condemned, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. Mark, <hi>He that believes not is condemned already;</hi> To wit, by the law, that is, the law doth condemn him, yea, it hath condemned him already for his ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, as it is written, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them, Gal.</hi> 3.10. Now all men as they come into the world are in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, condemned by the law. Yet not believing that their condemnation by the law really, they do not alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve really and effectually the law that doth condemn them. For as men have but a notion of the one, that is, their condemnation, becauſe of ſins againſt

                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 3</note> ſo they have but a notion of the condemning, killing, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of the law; for as the one is, ſo in theſe things, alwayes is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; there is no man that doth really believe the law or Goſpel further, then they do feel the power and authority of them in their hearts. <hi>Ye erre, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures nor the power of God.</hi> Now this letter, or law, is not to be taken in the largeſt ſenſe, but is ſtrictly to be tyed to the ten Commandments, whoſe proper work is onely by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoul its ſins againſt this law to kill, and there leaves him ſtark dead, not giving him the leaſt life, or ſupport, or comfort, but leaves the ſoul in an help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and hopeleſs condition as from it ſelf, or any other meer creature. 'Tis true, the law hath laid all men for dead, as they come into the world; but all men do not ſee themſelves dead, untill they ſee that law that ſtruck them dead, ſticking in their ſouls, and having ſtruck them that fatall blow.

Now he that is awakened and ſees this, ſees, that through this he is a dead man: Even ſo they that do ſee their ſtate by nature, being ſuch a ſad condition, do alſo ſee themſelves by that law to be dead men naturally.</p>
               <p>But now, when didſt thou feel the power of this firſt part of the Scripture, the law, ſo mighty as to ſtrike thee dead? if not, thou doſt not ſo much as verily believe that part of Scripture that doth contain the law in it, to be the truth of God. Yet if thou ſhouldeſt have felt ſomething, I ſay ſomething of the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling power of the law of God in thine heart, this is not an argument to prove that thou believeſt all the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture; for there is Goſpel as well as Law, and therefore I ſhall ſpeak to that alſo. That is, whether thou haſt felt the power of the Goſpel, as well as ſomething of the power of the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then if, thou haſt found the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Goſpel, and ſo believed it;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170678:126"/> thou haſt found it thus with thy ſoul. 1. Thou haſt been ſhewed by the word or truth of the Goſpel in the light of the Spirit of Chriſt, that by nature thou wert without the true faith of the Son of God in thy ſoul: For when <hi>He, the Spirit is come, he ſhall ſhew men that they believe not in me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, Joh. 16.9. For mark, though thou haſt, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, felt ſomewhat of the power of the Law, Letter, or ten Commandments, yet if thou haſt not been brought to this, to ſee by the ſpirit in the Goſpel, that thou art without faith by nature, thou haſt not yet taſted, much leſs believed any part of the Goſpel. For the Goſpel and the Law are two diſtinct covenants (as I have before ſhewed:) And they that are under the law maybe convinced by it, and ſo believe the law or firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and yet in the mean time to be a ſtranger to the covenant of promiſe; that is, the Goſpel, &amp; ſo have no hope in them, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12.) There is not any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that can be ſavingly believed, untill the ſoul be by the Goſpel converted to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. For though men do think ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much that they believe the things of the Goſpel, or the word of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170678:127"/> of our ſalvation, yet unleſs they have the work of grace in their ſouls, they do not, cannot rightly believe the things contained in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Again, as the law killeth thoſe that believe it, even ſo the promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Goſpel, do through faith adminiſter comfort to thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it aright. <hi>My words</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>my words, they are ſpirit, and they</hi> (Mark, <hi>and they) are life,</hi> Joh. 6.63. As if he had ſaid, The words contained in in the law as a covenant of works, they wound, they kill, they ſtrike dead thoſe that are under them. But as for me, <hi>the words that I ſpeake unto you, they are ſpirit and they are life.</hi> That is, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth receive them believingly, ſhall find them full of operation to comfort, quicken, and revive their ſoul. For as I did not come into the world to deſtroy mens lives, ſo the words that I ſpeak, as I am ſent to preach the Goſpel, they have no ſuch tendency unto thoſe that believe them. The promiſes that are in the Goſpel, Oh, how do they comfort them? ſuch a promiſe, and ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, O how ſweet is it? O how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to thoſe that believe them?
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170678:127"/> Alas, there are many poor ſouls that think they believe the Scriptures, that they believe the word of God, and yet poor ſouls that they are, they never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed any thing of the life and power of the promiſes to comfort them, after they were killed by the law: For mark, If thy comfort be indeed by the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they come in upon thy heart to quicken, to revive thee, to raiſe thee from the ſentence of death that is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on thee by the law. And through the faith that is wrought in thy ſoul by the operation of Gods holy Spirit (though once killed by the Law or Letter) thou art made alive in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, preſented to thy ſoul in the promiſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Doſt thou indeed and in truth believe the Scriptures to be the word of God, then the things contained in them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the things of the Goſpel are very excellent to thy ſoul, as the birth of Chriſt, the death, reſurrection, interceſſion, and ſecond coming of Chriſt, O how preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and excellent are they to thy ſoul, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that thou regardeſt nothing in compariſon of them. O! it is Chriſts birth, death, blood, reſurrection, &amp;c. according to the Scriptures, that thou doeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in exceedingly, and abundantly
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170678:128"/> deſire after, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. compare with <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Doeſt thou believe the Scriptures to be the word of God? Then thou ſtandeſt in aw of, and doſt much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence them. Why, they are the word of God, the true ſayings of God; they are the counſel of God; they are his promiſes and his threatnings. 'Tis like, poor ſouls are apt to think, If I could hear God ſpeak to me from heaven with an audible voice, then ſure, ſay they, I ſhould be ſerious, and ſure I ſhould believe it. But truly if God ſhould ſpeak to thee from heaven ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou wert converted, thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not regard nor really believe him. But if thou doeſt believe the Scriptures thou ſeeſt that they are the truth, as really as if God ſhould ſpeak to thee from heaven through the clouds, and therefore never flatter thy ſelf, fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinking, that if it were ſo, and ſo, then thou couldeſt believe. I tell thee, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If they believe not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they believe though one ſhould riſe from the dead.</hi> But,</p>
               <p n="5">5. Doeſt thou believe the Scripture to be the word of God? Then through
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170678:128"/> faith in Chriſt, thou endeavoureſt to have thy life ſquareed according to the Scriptures, both in word and practice. Nay, this, I ſay, thou mayeſt have, though thou do not believe them all. My meaning is, that if thou believe none but the ten Commandments, thy life may be according to them a legal holy life: and if thou do believe the Goſpel too, then thy life will be the faith of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; that is, either thou wilt live in the bleſſed and holy enjoyment of what is teſtified in the Scripture concerning the glorious things of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, or elſe, thou wilt be exceedingly panting after them. For the Scriptures carry ſuch a bleſſed beauty in them to that ſoul that hath faith in the things contained in them, that they do take the heart and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the ſoul of him that believeth them, into the love and liking of them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He that believes the Scriptures to be the word of God, if he do but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that any one place of the Scripture doth exclude him, and ſhut him out of, and from a ſhare in the promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them: O it will trouble him, grieve him, perplex him, yea he will not

For you muſt know, that to him that believes the Scriptures aright, the promiſes, or threatnings are of more power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or caſt down, then all the promiſes or threatnings of all the men in the world. And this was the cauſe why the Martyrs of Jeſus, did ſo ſlight both the promiſes of their adverſaries, when they would have overcome them with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the great things of this world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and alſo their threatnings, when they told them they would rack them, hang them, burn them; none of theſe things could prevail upon them, or againſt them, becauſe they did
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170678:129"/> moſt really believe the Scriptures, &amp; the things contained in them; as is cleerly found, and to be ſeen in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and alſo in Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> his records of their brethren.</p>
               <p n="7">7. He that believeth the Scriptures to be the word of God; believeth that men muſt be borne again, and have that faith which is of the operation of God, or elſe they cannot be ſaved. And he that believeth this, believeth alſo, that if he be not borne again, and alſo be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that faith which is of the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God, (according as he hath read and believed,) he muſt and ſhall be damned. And he that believeth this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, will not be contented until (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it is written,) he do partake of, and enjoy the new birth, and until he do find through grace that faith, that is wrought by the operation of God, in his ſoul. For this is the cauſe why men do ſatisfie themſelves with ſo ſlender a conceited hope that their ſtate is good, (when it is nothing ſo) namely, becauſe, they do not credit the Scripture; for did they, they would look into their own hearts, and examine ſeriouſly whether that faith, that hope, that grace which they think they have, be of that nature,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170678:130"/> and wrought by that ſpirit and power, that the Scripture ſpeaketh of. I ſpeak this of an effectual believing, without which all other is nothing unto ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now then becauſe I would not be too tedious, I ſhall at this time lay down no more diſcoveries of ſuch an one as doth ſavingly believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and the things contained in them, but ſhall ſpeak a few words of examination containing the things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thou ſayeſt thou doſt indeed and in truth effectually believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, I ask therefore, waſt thou ever killed ſtark dead by the law of works contained in the Scriptures? To be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and to be ſtruck dead, you will ſay, what is that? Why, to be killed by the law or letter, is by the power thereof to be made to ſee thy ſins againſt it, and to be left in an helpleſs condition by that law, for I ſay the proper work of the law is to ſlay the ſoul, and to leave it dead, in a helpleſs ſtate. For it doth neither give the ſoul any comfort it ſelf, when it comes, nor doth it ſhew the ſoul where comfort is to be had; and therefore it is called <hi>the miniſtration
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170678:130"/> of condemnation,</hi> as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. Yea in plain termes, <hi>the miniſtration of death,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. For though men may have a notion of the bleſſed word of God as as the children had, yet before they be converted, it may truly be ſaid of to them, <hi>Ye erre, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God,</hi> Mark 12.24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You ſay you do believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be the word of God. I ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, examine, waſt thou ever quickened from a dead ſtate by the power of the Spirit of Chriſt through the other part of the Scripture. That is to ſay, by the power of God in his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt through the covenant of promiſe. I tell thee from the Lord, if thou haſt, thou haſt felt ſuch a quickning power in the words of Chriſt, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 6.) that thou haſt been lifted out of that dead condition that thou before waſt in, and that when thou waſt under the guilt of ſin, the curſe of the law, and the power of the devil, and the juſtice of the great God; that thou haſt been inabled by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God in Chriſt revealed to thee by the Spirit, through, and by the Scripture, to look ſin, death, hell, the devil, and the law, and all things that are at enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170678:131"/> with thee for thy ſins, with boldneſs and comfort in the face, through the blood, death, righteouſneſs, reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and interceſſion of Chriſt made mention of in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, on this account, O how excellent are the Scriptures to thy ſoul! O how much virtue doſt thou ſee in ſuch a promiſe, in ſuch an invitation! O ſayeſt thou! there are ſome promiſes in the book of God that I have had nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from, and through Chriſt in them! O they are ſo large; they ſay Chriſt will in no wiſe caſt me out! My crimſon ſins ſhall be white as ſnow. I tell thee friend there are ſome promiſes that the Lord hath helped me to lay hold of Jeſus Chriſt through, and by, that I would not have out of the Bible, for as much Gold and Silver as can lie between York and London piled up to the ſtars. And why ſo? O becauſe through them Chriſt is pleaſed by his Spirit, to convey comfort to my ſoul! O I ſay, when the law curſes, when the Devil tempts, when hell-fire flames in my conſcience, my ſins with the guilt of them tearing of me, then is Chriſt revealed ſo ſweetly to my poor ſoul
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170678:131"/> through the promiſes: that all is forced to fly and leave off to accuſe my ſoul. So alſo, when the world frowns, when the enemies rage and threaten to knock me in the head, then alſo the precious, yea, the exceeding great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes do weigh down all, and comfort the ſoul againſt all. This is the effect of believing the Scriptures ſavingly; for they that do ſo, have by and through the Scriptures good comfort, <hi>and alſo ground of hope.</hi> Rom. 15.4. believing thoſe things to be its own which the Scriptures hold forth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Examine, doſt thou ſtand in aw of ſinning againſt God, becauſe he hath in the Scriptures commanded thee to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from it? Doſt thou give diligence to make thy calling and election ſure, becauſe God commandeth it in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? Doſt thou examine thy ſelf whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou be in the faith or no, having a command in Scripture ſo to do? Or doſt thou (notwithſtanding what thou readeſt in the Scripture, follow the world; delight in ſin; neglect coming to Jeſus Chriſt; ſpeak evil of the Saints; ſlight and make a mock at the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, delight in wicked company,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170678:132"/> and the like. Then know that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou doſt not indeed and in truth believe the Scriptures effectually. For as I ſaid before, if a man do believe them, and that ſavingly, O then he ſtands in aw, he looks to his ſteps, he turns his feet from evil, and endeavours to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that which is good, which God hath commanded in the Scriptures of truth; yet not from a legal or natural principle, that is, to ſeek for life by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that good thing, but knowing that ſalvation is already obtained for him, by the blood of that man Chriſt Jeſus on the Croſs, becauſe he believes the Scriptures; therefore (mark I pray) therefore I ſay, he labours to walk with his God, in all well pleaſing and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs becauſe the ſweet power of the loves of Chriſt which he feels in his ſoul by the Spirit according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, conſtrain him ſo to do, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Examine again, doſt thou labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe qualifications that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures do deſcribe a child of God by? that is faith, yea the right faith, the moſt holy faith, the faith of the operation of God. And alſo doſt thou examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170678:132"/> there is a real growth of grace in thy ſoul, as love, zeal, ſelf-denial and a ſeeking by all means to attain, (if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) to the reſurrection of the dead; that is, not to ſatisfie thy ſelf until thou be diſſolved &amp; rid of this body of death, and be transformed into that glory that the Saints ſhall be in after the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection day; and in the mean time doſt labour, and take all opportunities to walk as near as may be to the pitch, though thou know thou canſt not attain it perfectly, yet I ſay, thou doeſt aim at it, ſeek after it, preſs towards it, and to hold on in thy race thou ſhunneſt that which may any way hinder thee, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo cloſe in with what may any way fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame: knowing, that that muſt be, or deſiring that it ſhould be thine eternal frame, and therefore out of love and liking to it, thou doſt deſire and long after it, as being the thing that doth much pleaſe thy ſoul.</p>
               <p>Or how is it with thy ſoul? Art thou ſuch an one as regards not theſe things? but rather buſie thy thoughts about the things here below, following thoſe things that have no ſent of divine glory upon them: if ſo, look to thy ſelf, for
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170678:133"/> it is high time for thee ſo to do, for thou art an unbeliever, and ſo under the wrath of God, and wilt for certain fall into the ſame place of torment that thy fellows have fallen into before thee, to the grief of thy own ſoul, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction both of ſoul and body.</p>
               <p>Conſider and regard theſe things, and lay them to thy heart, before it be too late to recover thy ſelf by repenting of the one, and deſiring to cloſe in with the other. O I ſay, regard, regard, for hell is hot, Gods hand is up, the Law is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to diſcharge againſt thy ſoul; the judgement-day is at hand; the graves are ready to fly open, the trumpet is near the ſounding, the ſentence will ere long be paſt, and then you and I cannot call time again.</p>
               <p>Now then from what hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, there might many things be ſpoken by way of Uſe and Application: But I ſhall be very brief, and but touch ſome things and ſo wind up. And firſt, I ſhall begin with the ſad condition of thoſe that die out of Chriſt and ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to that. Secondly, to the latter end of the parable which more evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:170678:133"/> concerns the Scripture and ſpeak ſomewhat to that.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore you ſee that the former part of the parable contains a ſad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the ſtate of one living and dying out of Chriſt; how that they loſe heaven for hell, God for the devil, light for darkneſs, joy for ſorrow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How that they have not ſo much as the leaſt comfort from God, who in the time they live here below, neglect coming to him for mercy; not ſo much as one drop of cold water.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That ſuch ſouls will repent of their folly when repentance will do them no good, or when they ſhall be paſt recovery.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That all the comfort ſuch ſouls are like to have, they have it in this world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That all their groanings and ſighs will not move God to mitigate in the leaſt his heavy hand of vengeance that is upon them, for the tranſgreſſions they have committed againſt him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That their ſad ſtate is irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; or they muſt never, (mark) never come out of that condition.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There deſires will not be heard for
<pb facs="tcp:170678:134"/> their ungodly neighbours.</p>
               <p>From theſe things then I pray you conſider the ſtate of thoſe that die out of Chriſt Jeſus, yea I ſay, conſider their miſerable ſtate; and think thus with thy ſelf. Well, if I neglect coming to Chriſt, I muſt go to the devil, and he will not neglect to fetch me away into thoſe intollerable torments. Think thus with thy ſelf; What, ſhall I loſe a long heaven for ſhort pleaſure? ſhall I buy the pleaſures of this world at ſo dear a rate as to loſe my ſoul for the obtaining of that? Shall I content my ſelf with a heaven, that will laſt no longer then my life time? What advantage will theſe be to me when the Lord ſhall ſeparate ſoul and body aſunder, and ſend one to the grave, the other to hell, and at the judgement-day the final ſentence of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ruine muſt be paſt upon me?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider, that the profits, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and vanities of this world will not laſt ever, but the time is coming, yea juſt at the doors, when they will give thee the ſlip, and leave thee in the ſuds, and in the brambles of all that thou haſt done.</p>
               <p>And therefore to prevent this thy
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170678:134"/> diſmal ſtate, think thus with thy ſelf. 'Tis true, I do love my ſins, my luſts, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, but what good will they do me at the day of death, and of judgement? Will my ſins do me good then, will they be able to help me when I come to fetch my laſt breath? What good will my profits do me? and what good will my vanities do when death ſayes he will have no nay? What good will all my companions, fellow jeſters, jeerers, liars, drunkards, and all my wantons do me? will they help to eaſe the pains of hell? will theſe help <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nay, will not they rather cauſe God to ſhew me no mercy, to give me no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; but rather to thruſt me down in- into the hotteſt place in hell where I may ſwim in fire and brimſtone.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider thus with thy ſelf; Would I be glad to have all, every one of my ſins to come in againſt me to inflame the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God againſt me? would I be glad to be bound up in them as the three Children were bound in their clothes, and to be as really thrown into the fiery furnace of the wrath of almighty God, as they were into <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> fiery furnace.</p>

                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:170678:135"/>4. Conſider thus. Would I be glad to have all and every one of the ten Commandments to diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt my ſoul? The firſt ſaying damne him, for he hath broken me. The ſecond ſaying damne him, for he hath broken me, &amp;c.

Nay, this would not be comparable to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that the law (for the breach thereof) will give againſt thy ſoul: For thoſe can but kill the body; but theſe will kill both body and ſoul; and that, not for an hour, a day, a month, or a year, but they will condemn thee for ever.

It is into everlaſting damnation. eternal deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, eternal wrath and diſpleaſure from God, eternal gnawings of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, eternal continuance with devils.</p>
               <p>O conſider, it may be the thoughts of ſeeing the devil doth now make thine hair to ſtand right up on the head. O but this to be damned, to be among all the devils, and that not onely for a time,

               <p>This is, wonderfully miſerable, even miſerable; that no tongue of man, no nor of Angels is able to expreſs it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider thus with thy ſelf, not onely my ſins againſt the law will be laid to my charge, but alſo the ſins I have committed in ſlighting the goſpel, the glorious Goſpel; theſe alſo muſt come with a voice againſt me. As thus, Nay, he is worthy to be damned, for he rejected the Goſpel, he undervalued the Goſpel, he ſlighted the free grace of God tendred in the Goſpel. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times waſt thou (damned wretch) invited, intreated beſeeched to come to Chriſt, to accept of mercy, that thou mighteſt have heaven, thy ſins pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thy ſoul ſaved, and body and ſoul glorified, and all this for nothing but the acceptance, and through faith for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking thoſe imps of Satan, which by their embracements have drawn thee downward toward the gulf of Gods eternal diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>How often didſt thou read the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, yea the free promiſes of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſalvation? How oft didſt thou

               <p n="2">2. As I would have thee to conſider the ſad and woful ſtate of thoſe that die out of Chriſt, and are paſt all reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; ſo would I have thee conſider the many mercies and priviledges thou enjoyeſt above ſome (peradventure) of thy companions that are departed to their proper place. As firſt, conſider thou haſt ſtill the thread of thy life lengthened which for thy ſins might ſeaven years ago, or more, have been cut aſunder, and thou have dropped down among the flames.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, the termes of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation by faith in Chriſt, is ſtill profered unto thee, and thou invited, yea intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to accept of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. Conſider, the time of thy depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               <p n="6">6. Conſider, what a ſad reflection this will have on thy ſoul to ſee thy friends in heaven and thy ſelf in hell; thy Father in heaven, and thou in hell; thy Mother in heaven, and thou in hell; thy Brother, thy Siſter, thy Children in heaven, and thou in hell. As Chriſt ſaid to the Jews of their relations according the fleſh, ſo may I ſay to thee concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy friends, <hi>There ſhall be weeping

               <q>But again, becauſe I would not onely tell thee of the damnable ſtate of thoſe that die out of Chriſt, but alſo perſwade thee to take hold of life and go to heaven, take notice of theſe following things.</q>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, that what ever thou canſt do, as to thy acceptance with God, is not worth the dirt of thy ſhoes, but is <hi>all as menſtruous rags,</hi> Iſa. 64.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, that all the conditions of the new covenant (as to ſalvation) are and have been compleatly fulfilled by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and that for ſinners.</p>

               <p>And becauſe there is a gap open for poor ſinners to come from under the curſe and condemnation of the Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the grace of Chriſt, (for there is one made by the blood of Chriſt, he having broken down the middle wall of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) I ſhall ſpeak a few words further, and they are theſe.</p>
               <p>To invite ſinners, ſeeing there is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and deliverance to be had, to come in and accept of it, and that from theſe conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider thy ſtate by nature if thou come not in, which is this. Thou art under the breach of the law, and ſo under the curſe, which doth call for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible deſtruction.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, thou ſhalt groan and weep to ſee for what thou haſt brought thy ſelf into ſuch a ſad and miſerable condition. Thirdly, thou ſhalt weep to think that weeping and repenting will do thee no good. Fourthly, thou ſhalt ſee thy

O woful! woful! One would think this enough (if thou be not ſtark mad, and fully bent to give the devil thy ſoul) to make thee fly to Chriſt for ſuccour and help that thou mayeſt be delivered in the day of trouble.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore conſider ſeriouſly of theſe things. 1. May not the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils themſelves come in againſt thee, as well as <hi>Sodom</hi> that damned crue? May not they I ſay come in againſt thee and ſay, O thou ſimple man or woman! O vile wretch that had not ſo much care of thy ſoul, thy precious ſoul, as the beaſt hath of his young, or the dog of the very bone that lyeth before him. Was thy ſoul worth ſo much, and didſt thou ſo little regard it? were the thunder-claps of the law ſo terrible, and didſt thou ſo ſlight them? Beſides, was the Goſpel ſo freely, ſo frequently, ſo fully
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170678:139"/> tendered to thee, and yet haſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected all theſe things?</p>
               <p>Haſt thou valued ſin at an higher rate then thy ſoul? then God, Chriſt, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Saints, and Communion with them in eternal Bleſſedneſs, and Glory? Waſt thou not told of hell fire, thoſe intollerable flames? Didſt thou never hear of the intollerable roarings of the damned ones that are therein? Didſt thou never hear or read that doleful ſaying in the 16. of <hi>Luke,</hi> how the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man cries out among the flames, <hi>One drop of water to cool my tongue.</hi> Thus I ſay may the very devils, being ready to go with thee into the burning furnace of fire and brimſtone, though not for ſins of ſo high a nature as thine, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blingly ſay, Oh that Chriſt had died for devils, as he died for man! And, Oh that the Goſpel had been preached to us, as it hath been to thee! O how glad would we have been of it! How would we have laboured to have cloſed in with it? But woe be to us, for we might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have it profered; no, not in the leaſt, though we would have been glad of it. But you, you have had it profer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170678:140"/> preached, and proclaimed unto you; beſides, you have been intreated, and beſeeched to accept of it, but you would not. O ſimple fools! that might have eſcaped wrath, vengeance, hell fire, and that to all eternity, and had no heart at all to do it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 May not the meſſengers of Jeſus Chriſt alſo come in with a ſhrill and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible note againſt thy ſoul, when thou ſtandeſt at the bar of Gods Juſtice, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Nay, thou ungodly one, but how often haſt thou been forewarned of this day? Did we not ſound an alarum in thine ears, by the trumpet of Gods word day after day? How often didſt thou hear us tell thee of theſe things? Did we not tell thee ſin would damn thy ſoul? Did we not tell thee, that without converſion there was no ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Did we not tell thee, that they who loved their ſins, ſhould be damned at this dark and gloomy day, (as thou art like to be.)

               <p n="2">2. How unwillingly will thou ſet foot forward towards the lake of fire. Never did Malefactour ſo unwillingly turn off the ladder, when the halter was about his neck, as thou wilt turn from God to the devil, from heaven to hell, when the ſentence is paſſed upon thy ſoul.</p>
               <p>Oh how wilt thou ſigh and groan! Oh how willingly would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou hide thy ſelf, and run away from Juſtice; but alas! as
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170678:141"/> it is with them that are on the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ready to be executed, ſo it will be with thee. Alas, they would fain run away, but there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Halberd-men to ſtay them: And ſo the powers of God will beſet thee round, I ſay, round on every ſide, ſo that thou mayeſt indeed look, but run thou canſt not; thou mayeſt wiſh thy ſelf under ſome great rock or moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but how to get under thou knoweſt not.</p>

But alas, the father, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, brother, ſiſter, ſon, daughter, or friend rejects them, ſlights them, and turn their backs upon them, ſaying,

But O conſider how dreadful the place it ſelf, the devils themſelves, the fire it ſelf will be. And this at the end of all, here thou muſt lie for ever, here thou muſt fry for ever, and for ever. This will be more to thee, then any man with tongue can expreſs, or with pen can write; there is none that can, I ſay, by the ten thouſand part diſcover the ſtate and condition of ſuch a ſoul. O ſad.</p>
               <p>And now I ſhall give thee a few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations more, and they ſhall be thus, and ſo conclude.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, (for I would fain have thee come in ſinner) that there is way made by Jeſus Chriſt for them that are under the law of works, to come to this comfortable and bleſſed ſtate that I was

               <p n="2">2. Conſider, if thou never come, thy blood will be charged on thy own head; and ſo much the more, becauſe thou haſt been told of thy miſery and ſin: and alſo of the ſafety thou ſhalt be in, if thou do indeed come into this Lord Jeſus. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Then whoſoever heareth the ſound of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and taketh not warning, if the ſword commeth, and taketh away any perſon, his blood ſhall be upon his own head. He heard the ſound of the trumpet,</hi> (that is, the good news of the Goſpel) <hi>and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not warning,</hi> that is, did not fly to Jeſus Chriſt for ſuccour, <hi>his blood ſhall be upon his own head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, what pains Chriſt Jeſus took for the ranſoming of thy ſoul from all the curſes, thunder-claps, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts of the law; from all the intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble flames of hell; from that ſoul ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appearance of thy perſon (on the left hand) before the judgement-ſeat of Chriſt Jeſus, from everlaſting fellowſhip with innumerable companies of yelling, and ſoul-amazing devils. I ſay, conſider what pains the Lord Jeſus Chriſt took
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170678:143"/> in bringing in redemption for ſinners from theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that, <hi>Though he were rich, yet he became poor, that thou through his poverty might be made rich,</hi> 2 Cor. 8, 9. He laid aſide his glory, <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>and became a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> Phil. 2. He left the company of Angels, and incountred with the devil, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. He left heavens eaſe for a time to lie upon hard mountains, <hi>John</hi> 8. In a word, he became poorer then they that go with flail and rake; yea, then the very birds or foxes; and all to do thee good. Beſides, conſider a little of theſe unſpeakable and intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſlightings, and rejections, and the manifold abuſes that came from man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. How he was falſly accuſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſweet, harmleſs, and undefiled Lamb. How he was undervalued, ſo that a Murtherer was counted leſs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of condemnation then he. Beſides, how they mocked him, ſpat on him, beat him over the head with ſtaves, had the hair pluckt from his cheeks. <hi>I gave my back to the ſmiters, (ſaith he) and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting.</hi>

Inſomuch, that there was another fain for to carry his Croſſe.</p>
               <p>Again, not onely this, but lay to heart a little what he received from God his dear Father, though he were his dear and tender Son. Firſt, in that he did reckon him the greateſt ſinner, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell in the world: for he laid the ſins of thouſands, and ten thouſands, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of thouſands of ſinners to his charge, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. And cauſed him to drink the terrible cup that was due to them all: and not onely ſo, but did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſo doing; <hi>For it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him.</hi> God dealt indeed with his Son, as <hi>Abraham</hi> would have dealt with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> I, and more terribly by ten thouſand parts: for he did not onely tear his body like a lion, but made his ſoul an offering for ſin. And this was not done fainedly, but really (for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170678:144"/> called for it, he ſtanding in the room of ſinners) witneſs that horrible and unſpeakable agony that fell on him ſuddenly in the Garden, as if all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of Gods unſpeakable ſcalding ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance had been caſt upon him all at once, and all the devils in hell had been broken looſe from thence at once to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him, and that for ever; inſomuch, that the very pangs of death ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the ſame hour. For ſaith he, <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful and amazed, even unto death,</hi> Mark 14.33, 34.</p>
               <p>Witneſs alſo that ſtrange kinde of ſweat, that trickled down his moſt bleſſed face, where it is ſaid, <hi>And he ſweat, as it were, great,</hi> mark I beſeech you, <hi>great drops, or clodders of blood trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down to the ground.</hi> O Lord Jeſus, what a load didſt thou carry! what a burthen didſt thou bear of the ſins of the world, and the wrath of God! O thou didſt not onely bleed at noſe and mouth with the preſſure that lay upon thee, but thou waſt ſo preſſed, ſo loaden, that the pure blood guſhed through the fleſh and skin, and ſo ran trickling down to the ground, <hi>And his ſweat was, as it

Canſt thou read this, O thou wicked ſinner, and yet go in ſin? Canſt thou think of this, and defer repentance one hour longer? O heart of flint! yea, harder. O miſerable wretch! what place in hell will be hot enough for thee to have thy ſoul put into, if thou ſhalt perſiſt, or go on ſtill to adde iniquity to iniquity?</p>
               <p>Beſides, his ſoul went down to hell, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.31. and his body to the bars of the grave. And had hell, death, or the grave been ſtrong enough to hold him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then he had ſuffered the vengeance of eternal fire to all eternity. But O bleſſed Jeſus! how didſt thou diſcover thy love to man in thy thus ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering? And O God the Father! how didſt thou alſo declare thy purity and exactneſs of thy juſtice, in that, though it was thine onely, holy, innocent, harmleſs, and undefiled Son Jeſus, that did take on him our nature, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our perſons, anſwering for our ſins inſtead of our ſelves: thou didſt ſo wonderfully pour out thy wrath upon
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170678:145"/> him, to the making of him cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And O Lord Jeſus! what a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conqueſt haſt thou made over the enemies of our ſouls, even wrath, ſin, death, hell, and devils in that thou didſt wring thy ſelf from under the power of them all? and not onely ſo, but haſt led them captive, which would have led us captive; and alſo haſt received for us that glorious and unſpeakable inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>That eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive.</hi> And alſo haſt given thine ſome diſcovery thereof through thy Spirit.</p>
               <p>And now ſinner, together with this conſider. Fourthly, That though Jeſus Chriſt hath done all theſe things for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet the devils make it their whole work, and continual ſtudy how they may keep thee and others from enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe bleſſed priviledges that have been thus obtained for ſinners by this ſweet Jeſus. He labours I ſay, firſt, to keep thee ignorant of thy ſtate by nature. Secondly, to harden thy heart againſt the wayes of God. Thirdly, to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170678:145"/> inflame thy heart with love to ſin and the wayes of darkneſs. And fourthly, to get thee to continue herein. For that is the way he knows to get thee to be a partaker with him of the flaming hell fire, even the ſame that he himſelf is fallen into; together with the reſt of the wicked world by reaſon of ſin. Look to it therefore.</p>
               <p>But now in the next place a word of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to you that are the Saints of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, what an happy ſtate thou art in, that haſt gotten the faith of the Lord Jeſus into thy ſoul. (But be ſure thou have it) I ſay, how ſafe, how ſure, how happy art thou. For when others go to hell, thou muſt go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; when others go to the devil, thou muſt go to God; when as others go to priſon, thou muſt be ſet at liberty, at eaſe, and at freedom; when others muſt roar for ſorrow of heart, then thou ſhalt alſo ſing for the joy of heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider thou muſt have all thy well ſpent life to follow thee, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of all thy ſins: and the glorious
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170678:146"/> bleſſings of the Goſpel, inſtead of the dreadful curſes and condemnations of the Law. The bleſſing of the Father, inſtead of a fiery ſentence from the Judge.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let diſſolution come when it will, it can do thee no harm; for it will be but onely a paſſage out of a priſon, into a palace; out of a ſea of troubles, into an haven of reſt; out of a croud of enemies, to an innumerable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of true, loving, and faithful friends; out of ſhame, reproach, and contempt, into exceeding great, and eternal glory. For death ſhall not hurt thee with his ſting, nor bite thee with his ſoul-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering teeth, but ſhall be a welcome gueſt to thee, even to thy ſoul, in that it is ſent to free thee from thy troubles which thou art in whiles here, in this world, dwelling in the tabernacle of clay.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, conſider, how ever it goes with friends and relations, yet it will go well with thee, <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> 8.12 However it goes with the wicked, yet I know, Mark, yet I know (ſaith he) that it ſhall go well with them that fear
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170678:146"/> the Lord, that fear before him. And therefore let this in the firſt place cauſe thee chearfully to exerciſe thy patience under all the calamities, croſſes, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and afflictions that may come upon thee: and by patient continuance in well doing, to commit both thy ſelf and thine affairs, and actions into the hands of God, through Jeſus Chriſt, as to a faithful Creatour, who is true in his word, and loveth to give unto thee whatſoever he hath promiſed to thee.</p>
               <p>And therefore to incourage thee while thou art here with comfort, to hold on for all thy croſſes in this thy journey, be much in conſidering the place that thou muſt go into, ſo ſoon as diſſolution comes. It muſt be into heaven, to God the Judge of all, to an innumerable company of Angels, to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, to the general Aſſembly, and Church of the firſt born, whoſe names are written in heaven, and to Jeſus (too the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) who is the Mediatour of the new covenant, and to the blood of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that ſpeaks better things for thee,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170678:147"/> then <hi>Abels</hi> did for <hi>Cain, Hebrews</hi> 12.22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, that when the time of the dead that they ſhall be raiſed is come then ſhall thy body be raiſed out of the grave, and be glorified, and be made like to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. O excellent condition.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When Jeſus Chriſt ſhall ſit on the throne of his glory, you alſo ſhall ſit with him, even when he ſhall ſit on the throne of his glory. O Will not this be glorious, that when thouſands and thouſands of thouſands ſhall be arreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the judgement-ſeat of Chriſt, then for them to ſit with him upon the throne, together with him to paſs the ſentence upon the ungodly, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2, 3. Will it not be glorious to enjoy thoſe things that eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath entred into the heart of man to conceive.</p>
               <p>Will it not be glorious to have this ſentence, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world.</hi> Will it not be glorious to enter then with the Angels and Saints into that glorious
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170678:147"/> kingdom? Will it not be glorious for thee to be in glory with them, while others are in unutterable torments? O then! how will it comfort thee to ſee thou haſt not loſt that glory; to think that the devil hath not got thy ſoul; that thy ſoul ſhould be ſaved, and that not from a little, but from an exceeding danger; not with a little, but a great ſalvation. O therefore let the Saints be joyful in glory, let them triumph over all their enemies. Let them begin to ſing heaven upon earth, triumph be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to glory, ſalvation, even when they are in the midſt of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; <hi>For this honour ſhall all his Saints have,</hi> Pſal. 149.6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, for the latter part of the Parable, touching the Scriptures, and the certainty of them. Seeing they are ſo certain, ſo ſure, ſo irrevocable and firm; and ſeeing the ſaving faith of the things contained therein, is to reform the ſoul, and bring it over into the things of God, really conforming to the things contained therein, both to the point of Juſtification, and alſo
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170678:148"/> an impracticall walking, and giving up the ſoul and body to a conformity to all the commands, counſels, inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and exhortations contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. This then will learn us how to judge of thoſe who give up themſelves to walk in the imaginations of their own hearts, who ſlight and lay aſide the Scriptures, counting them but empty and uncertain things, and will live eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day in open contradiction to what is contained, commanded, and forbidden therein.</p>
               <p>As firſt, this will ſhew us that all your Drunkards, Whoremaſters, Liars, Thieves, Swearers, Back-biters, Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, Scoffers at goodneſs, &amp;c. I ſay, we may ſee by this, that they that live in ſuch things, have not the faith of the things contained in their hearts; ſeeing they delight to practiſe thoſe things that are forbidden by, and in them. And ſo they continuing living and dying in this ſtate, we may conclude without fear, that ſuch portions of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture belong unto them, and ſhall for certain be fulfilled upon them. <hi>He that believes not, ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark. 16.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170678:148"/> 16. <hi>The unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> 1. Corinthians 6.9, 10. <hi>But the abominable, the unbelei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, the whoremongers, and all liars ſhall have their part in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone,</hi> Revelation 21.8. <hi>Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels,</hi> M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tthew 25.41. Depart, that is, as if he ſhould ſay, Depart from me, for I will not ſave you. Depart, for my blood ſhall not at all waſh you. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, for you ſhall not ſet one foot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdom of heaven.</p>
               <p>Depart ye curſed, that is, ye are curſed of God, curſed of his Law, curſed of me, curſed by the Saints, and curſed by the Angels, curſed all over, nothing but curſed, and therefore depart from me, and whither? Into everlaſting fire; fire that will ſcald, ſcorch, burn, and flame to a purpoſe; fire that never ſhall be quenched, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. fire that will laſt to all eternity. And muſt we be all alone? No, you ſhall have company, ſtore of company with you. Namely, all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ers, men, women, and children. And if the Scriptures be true, (as they will one day wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear to be) then this muſt, and ſhall be thy portion if thou live and die in this ſtate, and of all them who continue in ſinning againſt the truths contained in Scriptures.</p>
               <p>As firſt, Doſt thou delight to ſin againſt plain commands, thou art gone?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Doſt thou ſlight and ſcorn the counſels contained in Scriptures, and continue in ſo doing, then thou art gone.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Doſt thou continually neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to come to Chriſt, and uſeſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in thine own heart to ſatisfie thy ſoul with ſo doing, then thou art gone? <hi>Luke</hi> 14.17, 18. compared with verſe 24. and <hi>Hebrews</hi> 2.3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> How ſhall we eſcape, that is, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ere is no way to eſcape.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe God hath ſaid we ſhall not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25. <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh, for if they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpake on earth</hi> (that
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170678:149"/> was <hi>Moſes) much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe he hath not onely ſaid, they ſhall not, but alſo hath bound it with an oath, ſaying, <hi>So I ſware in my wrath, they ſhall not enter into my reſt,</hi> Hebrews 3.11. But you will ſay, To whom did he ſwear that they ſhould not enter into his reſt? Anſ er. To them that believed not. <hi>So we ſee, they could not enter in, becauſe of unbelief.</hi> verſe 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this will teach us what to think and conclude of ſuch, who though they do not ſo openly diſcover their folly by open and groſſe ſins againſt the Law, yet will give more heed to their own ſpir ts, and the movings thereof, though they be neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, nor commended for the ſame in Scripture; nay, though the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture command and commend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 8.20. then they will to the holy and revealed will of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay, ſuch men are in as bad a ſtate as the other to the full, being diſobedient to Gods will revealed in his word, as well
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170678:150"/> as they, though in a different manner; the one openly tranſgreſſing againſt the plain and well known truths reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it; the other though more cloſe and hidden, yet ſecretly rejecting and ſlighting them, giving more heed to their own ſpirits, and the motion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, although not warranted by the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>A few words more, and ſo I ſhall conclude.</p>
               <p>And firſt, take heed that you content not your ſelf with a bare notion of the Scriptures in your heads, by which you may go far, even ſo far as to be able to diſpute for the truth, to preach the Goſpel, and labour to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it in oppoſition to gain-ſayers, and yet be found at the left hand of Chriſt at the Judgement-day, foraſmuch as thou didſt content thy ſelf with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or a traditionall knowledge of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Have a care, that thou own the whole Scripture, and not own one part, and neglect another, or ſlight it, as thus. To own the law, and ſlight the Goſpel; or to think that thou muſt be
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170678:150"/> ſaved by thy good doing and works, for that is all one, as if thou diddeſt thruſt Chriſt away from thee; or elſe ſo to own the Goſpel, as if by it thou wert exempted from all obedience to the ten Commandments, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Law in life and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For in ſo doing thou wilt for certain make ſure of eternall ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, have a care that thou put not wrong names on the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scriptures, as to call the Law Chriſt, and Chriſt the Law. For ſome having done ſo (in my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) have ſo darkened to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the glorious truths of the Goſpel, that in a very little time they have been reſolved to thwart and oppoſe them, and ſo have made room in their own ſouls for the Devil to inhabit, and obtained a place in hell for their own ſouls, to be tormented for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>Againſt this danger therefore in reading and receiving the teſtimony of Scripture, learn to diſtinguiſh between the Law and the Goſpel, and to keep
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170678:151"/> them clear aſunder, as to the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy ſoul, and that thou mayeſt ſo do. In the firſt place, beg of God, that he would ſhew thee the nature of the Goſpel, And ſet it home effectually with life and power upon thy ſoul by Faith. Which is this, That God would ſhew thee, that as thou being man haſt ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God; ſo Chriſt being God Man hath bought thee again, and with his moſt precious blood ſet thee free from the bondage thou waſt fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into by thy ſins; and that not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition, that thou wilt do thus and thus, this and the other good work, but rather, that thou being firſt juſtified freely by meer grace, through the blood of Jeſus, ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt alſo receive thy ſtrength from him who hath bought thee, to walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in all well pleaſing, being inabled thereto by vertue of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which hath revealed to thy ſoul, that thou art delivered already from wrath to come, by the obedience not of thee, but of another man, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:170678:151"/>
               <p>Secondly, Then if the law thou readeſt of, tell thee in thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, thou muſt do this and the other good work of the Law, if ever thou wilt be ſaved. Then anſwer plainly, that for thy part thou art reſolved now not to work for life, but to believe in the vertue of that blood ſhed upon the Croſſe upon Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> for the remiſſion of ſins: and yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt hath juſtified thee freely by his Grace, thou wilt ſerve him in Holineſſe and Righteouſneſſe all the dayes of thy life, yet not in a legall Spirit, or in a covenant of Works, but mine obedience (ſay thou) I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to have it free, and chearful, out of love to my Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Have a care thou receive not this doctrine in the notion onely, leſt thou bring a juſt damnation upon thy ſoul, by profeſſing thy ſelf to be freed by Chriſts blood from the guilt of ſin, while thou remaineſt ſtill a ſervant to the filth of ſin. For I muſt tell you, that unleſſe you have the true and ſaving work of the Faith and Grace of the Goſpel in your
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170678:152"/> hearts, you will either go on in a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Holineſs according to the tenour of the Law; or elſe through a notion of the Goſpel (the Devil bewitching, and beguiling thy underſtanding, will, and affections) thou wilt Ranter-like turn the Grace of God into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and bring upon thy ſoul double, if not treble damnation, in that thou couldeſt not be contented to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for thy ſins againſt the Law, but alſo to make ruine ſure to thy ſoul: thou wouldeſt diſhonour the Goſpel, and turn the Grace of God held forth, and diſcovered to man by that into li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs.</p>
               <p>But that thou mighteſt be ſure to eſcape theſe dangerous rocks on the right hand and on the left, ſee that thy faith be ſuch, as ſpoken of in Scripture: and that thou be not ſatisfied without that, which is a faith wrought by the mighty operation of God, revealing Chriſt to, and in thee, as having wholly freed thee from thy ſins by his moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood. Which faith if thou at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto, will ſo work in thy heart, that firſt thou wilt ſee the nature of the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170678:152"/> Law, and alſo the nature of the Goſpel, and delighting in the glory of it; and alſo thou wilt finde an ingaging of thy heart and ſoul to Jeſus Chriſt, even to the giving up of thy whole man unto him, to be ruled and governed by him to his glory, and thy comfort, by the Faith of the ſame Lord Jeſus.</p>
